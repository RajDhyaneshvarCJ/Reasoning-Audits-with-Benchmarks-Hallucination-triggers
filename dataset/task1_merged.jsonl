Nintendo's producer, Takao Nakano, played some of the company's mobile games, and believed they put care into them. A team from Nintendo met with the company in 2017, and was interested in a prototype conceptualized by Paladin Studios. Paladin Studios wanted to make a game that was easily accessible to a broad audience; they wanted a game that could be enjoyed by children and adults, as well as one that had simple controls. They decided to set the game in an office setting, as it was easily recognizable and would allow players to use common objects in surprising ways. They liked the contrast of a mundane office setting with chaotic and destructive actions.\n\nNintendo and Paladin Studios discussed regularly and worked together on the game very closely, actively video chatting each other to collaborate. Paladin Studios, located in The Netherlands, would create a working prototype of the game and send it to Nintendo in Japan for review every day. Both countries have opposite time zones, so every morning Nintendo had a prototype they could review, and every morning Paladin Studios had a review back from Nintendo. Due to both companies being in different parts of the world, it helped further their intentions of being enjoyable by a larger group of players. Although both companies had similar ideas, they sometimes had conflicting opinions on the office setting, as certain parts of a typical building were different in the two countries.\n\nThe developers encountered multiple bugs during the game's creation, such as glitch where every object in the level would immediately be destroyed. One of the glitches, where a printer wrapped in a cable would cause it to be violently launched in all directions, inspired the creators to increase the launch speed of cables. Due to the game revolving around physics, play testers found it enjoyable to search for hidden bugs.\n\nThe game had a two-year development cycle, and was announced on March 26, 2020, releasing the same day. Nintendo only told Paladin Studios that the game would be featured in a Nintendo Direct shortly before the announcement, which caught the company by surprise. Paladin studios commented how \"Nintendo did a tremendous job at guiding us through this process and really helped us make the best content we could possibly make.\"\n\n","prompt":"Which studio collaborated with Nintendo to develop the game \"Good Job!\"?","answer":"Paladin Studios","generation":"The game \"Good Job!\" was developed in collaboration between Nintendo and Paladin Studios.","run_id":"task_1_run_1","is_correct":true,"is_hallucinated":false}

By May, the committee had decided to allocate a minority of its funds to a decorative memorial, the rest to be used for practical purposes such as grants for war widows and orphans. They chose Lutyens to design the monument, desiring an eminent architect. Lutyens' first proposal was for a cenotaph and he built a wooden model for public exhibition on the sea front. This was rejected by public opinion, as was his next proposal, for an obelisk. The successful design, for a statue and column, was agreed in March 1920.

In June 1920, Lutyens visited Hove and chose a site in the middle of the road, near its northern end and parallel to the statue of Queen Victoria at the southern end. Lutyens designed dozens of war memorials across England, though Hove's was his only one in Sussex.

Set between 1965 and 1968, it begins where Angelou's previous book All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes ends, with Angelou's trip from Accra, Ghana, where she had lived for the past four years, back to the United States. Two \"calamitous events\" frame the beginning and end of the book—the assassinations of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. Angelou describes how she dealt with these events and the sweeping changes in both the country and in her personal life, and how she coped with her return home to the U.S. The book ends with Angelou at \"the threshold of her literary career\", writing the opening lines to her first autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.\n\nAs she had begun to do in Caged Bird, and continued throughout her series, Angelou upheld the long tradition of African-American autobiography. At the same time she made a deliberate attempt to challenge the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Most reviewers agreed that the book was made up of a series of vignettes. By the time Song was written in 2002, sixteen years after her previous autobiography, Angelou had experienced great fame and recognition as an author and poet. She recited her poem \"On the Pulse of Morning\" at the inauguration of President Bill Clinton in 1993, becoming the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since Robert Frost at John F. Kennedy's in 1961. She had become recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for Blacks and women. Angelou was, as scholar Joanne Braxton has stated, \"without a doubt, ... America's most visible black woman autobiographer\". She had also become, as reviewer Richard Long stated, \"a major autobiographical voice of the time\".\n\nThe title of Song was based upon the same poem, by African-American poet Paul Laurence Dunbar, the basis of her first autobiography. Like Angelou's other autobiographies, the book was greeted with both praise and disappointment, although reviews were generally positive. Reviewers praised Angelou for \"the culmination of a unique autobiographical achievement\", while others criticized her for coming across as \"smug\".

The description was made without the collection of a type specimen as they were too few to risk killing one. It is thought to be an endangered species, with a small population, and a very restricted distribution range within which commercial development threatens the habitat.\n\n ## Description\n\nThe Bugun liocichla is a small babbler (20 cm (7.9 in)) with olive-grey plumage and a black cap. The face is marked with prominent orange-yellow lores, and the wings have yellow, red and white patches. The tail is black with crimson coloured undertail coverts and red tips. The feet are pink and the bill is black at the face fading to pale white. A second duller individual was mist netted, which was probably the female. The voice is described as fluty and distinctive.\n\nA study of the evolution of the species within the genus Liocichla based on mitochondrial DNA sequence similarity showed that the species is most closely related to L. omeiensis with the Hengduan Mountains possibly acting as the isolating barrier between the two.\n\n ## Distribution and habitat\n\nAll sightings of the species have been at an altitude of 2,000 m (6,600 ft) on disturbed hillsides covered with shrubs and small trees, with the exception of one sighting on the edge of primary forest. It lives in a territory similar to that of the Emei Shan liocichla. Small flocks were observed during January, whereas pairs were observed in May, with an estimated total of 14 individuals. It is thought that pairs may hold and defend territories. The Bugun liocichla is only currently known from just one location.

Because of its resemblance to swallowtail butterflies, Drury described the species as Papilio rhipheus. The specimen Drury received had the head of a different species attached, probably that of a butterfly, which had clubbed antennae—this trait is frequently used to differentiate moths from butterflies. Once the inaccuracy in Drury's specimen was found, the moth was placed in the genus Urania, until 1823 when the German entomologist Jacob Hübner placed it in a new genus, Chrysiridia. The moth has also been described under other names. Because Drury described his specimen as having clubbed antennae and being tailless, William Swainson thought it was a different species than the complete specimen described by Pieter Cramer. In 1833, Swainson named the butterfly Rhipheus dasycephalus and the moth Leilus orientalis. Other synonyms include U. crameri by Maassen in 1879 and U. ripheus var. madagascariensis by Lesson in 1831.\n\nNative Malagasy people call it adriandolo or lolonandriana, from lolo for \"spirit\" or \"butterfly\" and andriana for \"noble\" or \"king\", therefore meaning \"noble butterfly\", \"noble spirit\", \"king butterfly\" or \"king spirit\".\n\nThe genus Chrysiridia is entirely African and the only other species in the genus is the East African C. croesus. Chrysiridia is one of three diurnal uraniine genera. The other two genera are Urania, its sister taxon, and Alcides, the most basal.

The size is chosen based on the patient's body size, with the smaller sizes being used for infants and children. Most endotracheal tubes have an inflatable cuff to seal the tracheobronchial tree against leakage of respiratory gases and pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents, blood, secretions, and other fluids. Uncuffed tubes are also available, though their use is limited mostly to children (in small children, the cricoid cartilage is the narrowest portion of the airway and usually provides an adequate seal for mechanical ventilation). In addition to cuffed or uncuffed, preformed endotracheal tubes are also available. The oral and nasal RAE tubes (named after the inventors Ring, Adair and Elwyn) are the most widely used of the preformed tubes. There are a number of different types of double-lumen endo-bronchial tubes that have endobronchial as well as endotracheal channels (Carlens, White and Robertshaw tubes). These tubes are typically coaxial, with two separate channels and two separate openings. They incorporate an endotracheal lumen which terminates in the trachea and an endobronchial lumen, the distal tip of which is positioned 1–2 cm into the right or left mainstem bronchus. There is also the Univent tube, which has a single tracheal lumen and an integrated endobronchial blocker. These tubes enable one to ventilate both lungs, or either lung independently. Single-lung ventilation (allowing the lung on the operative side to collapse) can be useful during thoracic surgery, as it can facilitate the surgeon's view and access to other relevant structures within the thoracic cavity. The \"armored\" endotracheal tubes are cuffed, wire-reinforced silicone rubber tubes. They are much more flexible than polyvinyl chloride tubes, yet they are difficult to compress or kink. This can make them useful for situations in which the trachea is anticipated to remain intubated for a prolonged duration, or if the neck is to remain flexed during surgery. Most armored tubes have a Magill curve, but preformed armored RAE tubes are also available. Another type of endotracheal tube has four small openings just above the inflatable cuff, which can be used for suction of the trachea or administration of intratracheal medications if necessary.

Another studio album with this formation, The House of Blue Light followed in 1987 but Gillan was concerned with the final results, stating \"There's something missing in the overall album. I can't feel the spirit of the band.\" This was followed by the live album Nobody's Perfect in 1988.

Starr followed Sentimental Journey with the country-inspired Beaucoups of Blues, engineered by Scotty Moore and featuring renowned Nashville session musician Pete Drake.

It is one of the best known saber-toothed predators and one of the most famous prehistoric mammals. Although commonly known as the saber-toothed tiger, it was not closely related to the tiger or other modern cats. Smilodon lived in the Americas during the Pleistocene epoch (2.5 mya – 10,000 years ago). The genus was named in 1842 based on fossils from Brazil; the generic name means \"scalpel\" or \"two-edged knife\" combined with \"tooth\". Three species are recognized today: S.gracilis, S.fatalis, and S.populator. The two latter species were probably descended from S.gracilis, which itself probably evolved from Megantereon. The hundreds of specimens obtained from the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles constitute the largest collection of Smilodon fossils. Overall, Smilodon was more robustly built than any extant cat, with particularly well-developed forelimbs and exceptionally long upper canine teeth. Its jaw had a bigger gape than that of modern cats, and its upper canines were slender and fragile, being adapted for precision killing. S.gracilis was the smallest species at 55 to 100 kg (120 to 220 lb) in weight. S.fatalis had a weight of 160 to 280 kg (350 to 620 lb) and height of 100 cm (39 in). Both of these species are mainly known from North America, but remains from South America have also been attributed to them. S.populator from South America was the largest species, at 220 to 436 kg (485 to 961 lb) in weight and 120 cm (47 in) in height, and was among the largest known felids. The coat pattern of Smilodon is unknown, but it has been artistically restored with plain or spotted patterns. In North America, Smilodon hunted large herbivores such as bison and camels, and it remained successful even when encountering new prey species in South America. Smilodon is thought to have killed its prey by holding it still with its forelimbs and biting it, but it is unclear in what manner the bite itself was delivered. Scientists debate whether Smilodon had a social or a solitary lifestyle; analysis of modern predator behavior as well as of Smilodon's fossil remains could be construed to lend support to either view. Smilodon probably lived in closed habitats such as forests and bush, which would have provided cover for ambushing prey. Smilodon died out at the same time that most North and South American megafauna disappeared, about 10,000 years ago. Its reliance on large animals has been proposed as the cause of its extinction, along with climate change and competition with other species, but the exact cause is unknown.","prompt":"What was the weight range of the Smilodon populator species?","answer":"220 to 436 kg (485 to 961 lb)","generation":"The weight of Smilodon populator, one of the largest species of the saber-toothed cat, is estimated to have ranged from approximately 220 to 400 kilograms (about 485 to 880 pounds).

Additionally, Frazee still owed Lannin as much as \\$125,000 from the purchase of the club. Although Ruppert and his co-owner, Colonel Tillinghast Huston, were both wealthy, and had aggressively purchased and traded for players in 1918 and 1919 to build a winning team, Ruppert faced losses in his brewing interests as Prohibition was implemented, and if their team left the Polo Grounds, where the Yankees were the tenants of the New York Giants, building a stadium in New York would be expensive.

Fantasy was forced to close down in 1939 as the war approached: the editor, T. Stanhope Sprigg, had enlisted in the RAF, and it was clear to the publisher, George Newnes Ltd, that paper rationing would soon be implemented. Tales of Wonder, published by The World's Work, was edited by Walter Gillings, who had been active in science fiction fandom since the early 1930s. Gillings was able to keep Tales of Wonder going until 1942, despite the paper shortages; even after he was drafted he was able to edit it for a while from his army camp, but the Spring 1942 issue was the last one. By 1943 Gillings was planning a new magazine, to be published by Temple Bar. He started collecting material for it, requesting stories that showed originality and focused on \"how technological advances might affect individuals rather than whole populations\", in the words of sf historian Mike Ashley. Paper rationing was still a concern, and Temple Bar were not convinced there was a sufficient market for sf, so they kept delaying the launch. Gillings's initial request for submissions was not fruitful, but by 1946 he had acquired enough material for nine issues. This included several stories by Arthur C. Clarke, though he returned some of them to Clarke as the publication delays lengthened, suggesting Clarke try them in the American market. Two of the stories, \"Loophole\", and \"Rescue Party\", appeared in Astounding Science Fiction in the April and May 1946 issues; these were Clarke's first professional fiction sales. Temple Bar finally took the plunge in 1946, convinced by the success of New Worlds, another British sf magazine, which had been launched that summer. The first issue, in digest format, was dated December 1946. The title was Fantasy, though there was no connection to Newnes' pre-war pulp magazine of that name; it was subtitled \"The Magazine of Science Fiction\". The lead story was \"Last Conflict\", by John Russell Fearn, and the issue also included a reprint of \"The Worlds of If\", a story by Stanley Weinbaum, and Clarke's \"Technical Error\"—his first sale to a British market.","prompt":"What was the subtitle of the magazine \"Fantasy\" launched in 1946?","answer":"The Magazine of Science Fiction","generation":"The magazine \"Fantasy,\" which was launched in 1946, had the subtitle \"A Magazine of Science Fiction.\"","run_id":"task_1_run_10","is_correct":false,"is_hallucinated":true}

The move induced the lawyer and writer E. S. P. Haynes to produce \"The Taboos of the British Museum Library\", an essay in the literary magazine The English Review. Describing the existence of the Private Case as \"unsatisfactory\", he criticised the museum for censorship and wrote that \"the reputation of our National Library is suffering in consequence\" of the segregation of books. The library practice of keeping the names of Private Case books off the general catalogue he thought \"a ruinous policy, and one which in the long run may prove suicidal. Students will tend to go elsewhere\". He also stated that by censoring the existence of works in its holdings, the library \"is placing itself in a most dubious position\". Despite Haynes's essay the wider public continued to be unaware of the existence of the Private Case until the 1960s and it was only in 1962 that the library acknowledged that it held a collection of books not included in the main general catalogue. The situation of the segregated books was not discussed more widely until 1963 when there was a debate in the correspondence pages of The Times Literary Supplement about the library's policy. One of those involved in the correspondence was Peter Fryer, who went on to publish Private Case—Public Scandal: Secrets of the British Museum Revealed in 1966; the book was part of what Harris calls Fryer's \"courteous but persistent campaign on the subject\".

While the colony was previously stable, the Marker's discovery prompts a wave of unusual incidents; beginning first as prevalent insomnia and hallucinations, many colonists then display symptoms of paranoia and become murderously violent. One of the colonists attacks medical officer Tom Sciarello, killing his assistant in the process. The Unitologists in the colony exacerbate the situation, as they attempt to worship at the Marker site. One of their number is Neumann's P-SEC partner Vera Cortez, and her beliefs and gradual decline drive a wedge between them. Marla Janssen, another P-SEC officer, becomes fascinated by symbols on the Marker seen on a leaked video. The colony leader Hanford Carthusia is given orders from the Unitology Church to safeguard the Marker until their ship, the Ishimura arrives. Between its discovery and the Ishimura's arrival, the situation deteriorates further; Sciarello treats a growing and increasingly severe outbreak of hysteria and paranoia on the colony, technician Cameron finds an unusual organic matter growing in the vent system, and one of the Marker security team Natalia Deshyanov kills a crewmember and suffers a complete breakdown. Carthusia, under orders from the Church, refuses to act and instead brings the Marker into the colony preparatory to sending both it and the colony's recent dead to the Ishimura. The Marker's approach prompts a mass suicide of Unitologists, among them Cortez.","prompt":"What object discovered on the planet Aegis VII is central to the plot of Dead Space?","answer":"Marker","generation":"The object discovered on the planet Aegis VII that is central to the plot of Dead Space is the \"Red Marker.\" The Red Marker is an alien artifact that plays a crucial role in the story, as it is linked to the outbreak of the Necromorphs and the mental effects experienced by the game's characters.","run_id":"task_1_run_10","is_correct":true,"is_hallucinated":false}

It was based on Bailey and Bichoff's 1976 short story, and subsequent 1979 novel, Tin Woodman. Both the short story\/novel and the episode are named for the Tin Woodman from L. Frank Baum's Oz books.\n\nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, telepath Tam Elbrun (Harry Groener) joins the crew to investigate a bio ship detected near a star about to go supernova. As the crew investigates, the Romulans threaten the Enterprise and the creature, Gomtuu, and Elbrun boards it with Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner). As the star is about to explode, Gomtuu sends Data back to the Enterprise and the two ships out of the system. Gomtuu and Elbrun leave together as the star goes supernova.\n\nThe spec script was chosen as the crew believed it could go into production quickly. After purchasing it, the production of this episode began a week later. Groener guest starred as Elbrun, the first male Betazoid seen on the show. Michael Cavanaugh appeared as Captain Robert DeSoto, a character that was mentioned in \"Encounter at Farpoint\" and later in the franchise. The design of Gomtuu was based on an element from The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension, while the chair creation special effect was made using reverse motion. \"Tin Man\" received Nielsen ratings of 10.2 percent.

Upon her arrival, Peresvet became the flagship of the squadron's second-in-command, Rear Admiral Prince Pavel Ukhtomsky. During the Battle of Port Arthur (February 1904) on the second day of the war, Peresvet was not hit, but Pobeda was hit once amidships, sustaining little damage but losing two men killed and four wounded. Pobeda struck a mine during the squadron's sortie on 13 April and remained under repair for almost two months. Both ships had some of their anti-torpedoboat guns and secondary armament removed during the summer to bolster the defenses of the port. They participated in the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August 1904; Pobeda was only lightly damaged by 11 large-caliber hits, but Peresvet, hit 39 times, suffered a considerable amount of flooding. More guns were landed after the squadron's return to Port Arthur, but the Imperial Japanese Army captured the hills overlooking the harbor in November, and this allowed Japanese 28-centimeter (11 in) siege guns to fire directly at the Russian ships.

He insists that he and Jane must marry and tells her he will earn money, but Jane tells him that it will not be enough; he will never be able to make enough money to support his dependants with a High Court judge (his uncle) as an enemy and with a penniless wife. Distraught, Tom asks her if she loves him, and she replies, \"Yes, but if our love destroys your family, then it will destroy itself, in a long, slow degradation of guilt and regret and blame.\" Jane returns home and receives a proposal from John Warren. She declines, and suddenly accuses him of being the one who wrote to the Judge and denied her chances of happiness. Lady Gresham informs Jane that Mr. Wisley is withdrawing his proposal, but Wisley and Jane talk afterwards and part as friends. Twenty years later, Jane, now a successful author and by choice unmarried, sees Tom during a gathering. Henry, now married to Eliza, brings Tom to her. Tom introduces his eldest daughter, who admires Jane's novels. Tom's daughter asks Jane to read aloud, but as Jane rarely does so Tom remonstrates with his daughter calling her by name - which is also Jane. Astonished that he named his eldest after her, Jane agrees to her request. The last scene shows Tom's daughter sitting by Jane as she reads aloud from Pride and Prejudice, while Tom watches Jane affectionately. As she concludes, their eyes meet and Tom joins the rest of the company in honouring Jane and her work with applause. ## Cast\n\n- Anne Hathaway as Jane Austen\n- James McAvoy as Thomas \"Tom\" Lefroy\n- Julie Walters as Mrs. Austen\n- James Cromwell as Reverend George Austen\n- Maggie Smith as Lady Gresham\n- Lucy Cohu as Eliza, Comtesse de Feuillide\n- Laurence Fox as Mr. Wisley\n- Joe Anderson as Henry Austen\n- Ian Richardson as Lord Chief Judge Langlois of London\n- Sophie Vavassuer as Jane Lefroy\n- Anna Maxwell Martin as Cassandra Austen\n- Leo Bill as John Warren\n- Jessica Ashworth as Lucy Lefroy\n- Eleanor Methven as Mrs Lefroy\n- Helen McCrory as Mrs Radcliffe\n- Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Robert Fowle\n\n ## Production\n\n","prompt":"Who is Jane Austen played by in \"Becoming Jane\"?","answer":"Anne Hathaway","generation":"In the film \"Becoming Jane,\" Jane Austen is played by Anne Hathaway.","run_id":"task_1_run_10","is_correct":true,"is_hallucinated":false}

They were connected via a cold call from GE's Bob Hichborn, who met with Sega executives at the division's Daytona Beach, Florida headquarters in 1990, and later at Sega's headquarters in Tokyo in November of the same year. At the second meeting, GE Aerospace executives brought a tape demonstrating the hardware's 3D graphics simulating the Daytona International Speedway. GE estimated that their sale of the Model 2’s graphics technology accelerated Sega's arcade hardware development by 14 months. The heads of Sega's regional offices began discussing ideas for games to demonstrate the Model 2's capabilities. Sega's previous board, the Model 1, had debuted in 1992 with Virtua Racing, which was popular in Japan and Europe. Tom Petit, president of Sega's American arcade division Sega Enterprises USA, suggested that NASCAR would be an attractive brand to use for a Model 2 game in the US. Though Sega Europe's Vic Leslie had reservations due to the greater popularity of Formula One in Europe, Sega executives approved the concept. Petit and Sega Enterprises USA chief of finance Masahiro Nakagawa began negotiations with representatives of the Daytona 500 at Daytona International Speedway for a license to develop a game based on the race. To lower costs, Sega decided not to negotiate with NASCAR for a license, and so the game does not contain real sponsors, drivers, or cars. Sega mandated that Daytona USA had to be better than Namco's 1993 racing game Ridge Racer and it had to achieve higher sales. Ridge Racer had reached the top of arcade sales charts at the end of 1993 and beginning of 1994, and it had received highly favorable reviews of its graphics, especially in comparison to Virtua Racing. Development was handed to Sega AM2, a development division headed by Yu Suzuki, who had led development on popular racing games including Hang-On, Out Run, and Virtua Racing. AM2 director Toshihiro Nagoshi was given direct responsibility for the project, with Nagoshi and Suzuki serving as producers. The game was Nagoshi's first project as a director. Nagoshi was aware of the racing arcade games already on the market and decided he wanted to take his game in a different direction.","prompt":"Which Sega development division was responsible for creating Daytona USA?","answer":"Sega AM2","generation":"Daytona USA was developed by Sega AM2, a division of Sega known for creating many popular arcade games.","run_id":"task_1_run_10","is_correct":true,"is_hallucinated":false}

Like other Maine farmers of the era who were struggling to compete in an expanding agricultural market, the Tuttles' methods of farming gradually depleted the soil of essential nutrients. Subsequent overgrazing by large numbers of sheep produced widespread erosion of the topsoil, exposing a deposit of aeolian sand that was lying underneath. Eventually the entire farm became barren, and the Tuttles abandoned the land in 1890. For years, it was known as \"the sand farm\" and was a popular local feature.

In May 1819, he was posted to Singapore with the 2nd Battalion of the 20th Regiment of Bengal Native Infantry with the rank of Assistant Surgeon. Upon his arrival, he took over as senior surgeon of Singapore from a more junior officer, and was given the rank of acting Surgeon. In 1827, Montgomerie was posted back to Bengal. In 1835, the medical department headquarters was moved from Penang to Singapore, whereupon Montgomerie was made the head. He retired to England in January 1844. He was recalled to Bengal some years later as Garrison Surgeon at Fort William, Calcutta, and was Superintendent Surgeon in the field during the Second Anglo-Burmese War (1852–1853). He died of cholera at Barrackpore, India, on 21 March 1856 and was buried in Fort William.\n\nWhile he was stationed at Singapore, Montgomerie was usually the doctor attending Singapore's leaders. These included Stamford Raffles, the founder of Singapore, and William Farquhar, who was stabbed by a would-be assassin in 1823. Farquhar had expressed concern over Montgomerie's youth when he arrived in Singapore in 1819. Montgomerie was very young at this point, even younger than the Sub-assistant Surgeon from whom he took over and was now in charge. If anything happened to Farquhar, Montgomerie would have been left in charge of Singapore as the next most senior official. Farquhar wrote to Calcutta asking them to put alternative arrangements in place.\n\nIn Singapore, Montgomerie was appointed a magistrate in 1819, head of the botanical experimental gardens in 1823 (where he concentrated on cultivating spices), and sheriff in 1837.\n\n ## Agriculture\n\nMontgomerie keenly pursued agriculture in Singapore. He owned the 32-acre (13 ha) Duxton Hill estate for most of his time there, but never succeeded in making it profitable. It was sold after his death and briefly renamed \"Woodsville\". The area is now built-up and the name has reverted to Duxton Hill, a name also preserved in Duxton Road. The primary crop grown was sugar, but later he planted nutmeg trees. The estate was bounded by a river where Montgomerie had a large watermill. A short distance from the mill, the Serangoon Road crosses the river on a crossing known as Montgomerie's Bridge.\n\n ### Spice cultivation\n\nOn his return to Singapore in 1835, Montgomerie found that the government spice plantations had been neglected. The clove crop had been destroyed by blight, but since the nutmeg trees still looked healthy, Montgomerie decided to start his own plantation with seeds procured from Penang. He believed that enough nutmeg could be grown in Singapore to supply the entire British Empire by 1850, and that the price could be driven down to something affordable by ordinary people. However, he complained that the government land leasing arrangements were not favourable in Singapore, and discouraged farming. He compared this to Ceylon (now known as Sri Lanka, but at the time a British possession) where land could be bought outright. In 1842, Montgomerie sent a box of nutmeg and mace to the Society of Arts (later to become the Royal Society) for which he was awarded a gold medal.\n\n","prompt":"What was the primary crop grown on William Montgomerie's 32-acre Duxton Hill estate in Singapore?","answer":"sugar","generation":"The primary crop grown on William Montgomerie's 32-acre Duxton Hill estate in Singapore was nutmeg.

These ombiasy also often trained the spiritual leaders of other communities, further reinforcing the preeminence of the Matitana ombiasy as masters of arcane knowledge and those outside their clan who sought to learn or dispense it. The Zafikasimambo used their right to conduct sombily (ritual sacrifice) to shape and increasingly control political and economic activities in the area. To end the conflict with the Zafiraminia, they executed as many males of the group as possible and relegated the women and children to restricted areas. In this way they established the first strong Antemoro kingdom. They are rare among Malagasy clans as newcomers who successfully established their own kingdom within a short time after landing on the island. Under Antemoro Zafikasimambo leadership, the commoners' freedom was significantly reduced and religion became a central feature of social and political life. The conflict between the Antemoro and Zafiraminia nobles and the resulting Zafikasimambo rule also established a tradition of emigration from this part of the island. Unlike the majority of Malagasy who generally seek to return to their ancestral land, the Antemoro initially felt no such call to remain linked to a geographic area. As a result, the ombiasy of the Antemoro traveled widely, some moving from place to place and others settling permanently at royal courts and elsewhere. Their arcane knowledge of writing, medicine, technology and other areas both established their reputation as indispensable advisers to nobles and commoners alike, and instilled the island-wide feature of the community astrologer who shapes daily life. The ombiasy of Matitana were According to historian Bethwell Ogot, the network of stationary and itinerant Antemoro ombiasy were key in transforming the societies of Madagascar from an amalgam of insular clans to outward looking communities with greater awareness of others, leading to territorial expansion and larger, more complex kingdoms. In addition, oral histories suggest that sovereigns among the Merina, Tanala and Antanosy may have had ancestors who migrated away from Antemoro country. By the early 18th century, the Antemoro had established themselves as major rice and slave exporters. Throughout the 1700s, the Antemoro were embroiled in a conflict with the Ikongo-Tanala that culminated in a bloody Tanala invasion of the eastern coastal plain. Shortly afterward, a major Antemoro leader named Andriamamohotra established an alliance and vassal relationship with the king then ruling Imerina, Andrianampoinimerina, to reestablish peace.","prompt":"Who initially established the first strong Antemoro kingdom?","answer":"The Zafikasimambo clan.","generation":"The first strong Antemoro kingdom was established by Samoala.

They are dark red to reddish-orange, becoming a paler orange to yellowish at the margin. The cap surface is densely covered with red to orange to yellow, powdery to granular remnants of the volva. The cap margin is grooved—with the grooves extending to between 30% and 60% of the radius—and does not have partial veil remnants hanging along the cap margin. The flesh of the mushroom is white to yellow, or reddish immediately beneath the cap cuticle. The white gills are free from attachment to the stem and are 3 to 6 mm (0.12 to 0.24 in) broad. The lamellulae (short gills that do not extend fully from the cap edge to the stem) are truncate, and typically range in length between 15 and 50% of the length of the gills. The stem is 50–100 mm (2.0–3.9 in) by 5–10 mm (0.2–0.4 in) thick, roughly cylindrical or slightly larger upwards, with a surface that is cream above the ring and cream to yellowish below. The bulb at the base of the stem is roughly spherical, and 1–2 cm (0.4–0.8 in) wide, with its upper part covered with red, orange to yellow woolly to powdery remnants of the volva. The volva remains in mature specimens as a ring around the upper part of the stem bulb. The ring is membranous, persistent, with an upper surface that is white and a lower surface having a yellowish tinge and an edge that is red to orange. Amanita rubrovolvata produces a white to cream-colored spore print. The spores are spherical or nearly so, and typically measure 7.5–9.0 by 7.0–8.5 μm. They are inamyloid, meaning that they will not absorb iodine stain from Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells in the hymenium) are club-shaped, four-spored (rarely two-spored), and measure 25–44 by 10–14 μm. The sterigmata (slender extensions at the basidial tips that attach to the spores) are 3–4 μm long, and clamps are not found on the bases of basidia. Although the edibility or toxicity of the mushroom is not known with certainty, it has been reported to cause \"neurological symptoms\" in mice, as well as increased levels of blood glucose and decreased blood urea nitrogen. Other biochemical changes reported in mice, after peritoneal injection of fruit body extract, include decreases in the activity of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase and reduced levels of liver glycogen. In these experiments, values returned to normal six hours after initial injection, suggesting that the poisoning was not serious, and did not affect liver and kidney performance. ### Similar species\n\nSanmee and colleagues mention that the eastern North American species A. frostiana resembles A. rubrovoltata slightly, but the former has short grooves at the edge of a yellowish-orange cap, slightly larger spores, a yellow volva, and clamps at the basidial bases.

She carried a maximum of 2,027 tonnes (1,995 long tons) of coal which allowed her to steam for 3,370 nautical miles (6,240 km; 3,880 mi) at a speed of 10 knots (19 km\/h; 12 mph).\n\nDiderot's main battery consisted of four 305mm\/45 Modèle 1906 guns mounted in two twin gun turrets, one forward and one aft. The secondary battery consisted of twelve 240mm\/50 Modèle 1902 guns in twin turrets, three on each side of the ship. A number of smaller guns were carried for defense against torpedo boats. These included sixteen 75 mm (3.0 in) L\/65 guns and ten 47-millimetre (1.9 in) Hotchkiss guns. The ship was also armed with two submerged 450 mm (17.7 in) torpedo tubes. The ship's waterline armor belt was 270 mm (10.6 in) thick and the main battery was protected by up to 300 mm (11.8 in) of armor. The conning tower also had 300 mm thick sides.\n\n ### Wartime modifications\n\nDuring the war 75 mm anti-aircraft guns were installed on the roofs of the ship's two forward 240 mm gun turrets. During 1918, the elevation of the 240 mm guns was increased which extended their range to 18,000 meters (20,000 yd).\n\n ## Career\n\nConstruction of Diderot began on 26 December 1906 by Ateliers et Chantiers de la Loire in Saint-Nazaire and the ship was laid down on 20 October 1907. She was launched on 19 April 1909 and was completed on 1 August 1911. The ship was assigned to the First Division of the First Squadron (escadre) of the Mediterranean Fleet when she was commissioned. The ship participated in combined fleet maneuvers between Provence and Tunisia in May–June 1913 and the subsequent naval review conducted by the President of France, Raymond Poincaré on 7 June 1913. Afterwards, Diderot joined her squadron in its tour of the Eastern Mediterranean in October–December 1913 and participated in the grand fleet exercise in the Mediterranean in May 1914.\n\n","prompt":"What was the top speed reached by the French battleship Diderot during her sea trials?","answer":"19.9 knots (36.9 km\/h; 22.9 mph)","generation":"The French battleship Diderot reached a top speed of 20.7 knots during her sea trials.","run_id":"task_1_run_11","is_correct":false,"is_hallucinated":true}

She cites the emotional vocals of Kate Bush and Sinéad O'Connor, as well as Laurie Anderson's use of vocoder as inspiration for her vocal delivery on the album. The Daily Telegraph writer Neil McCormick noted that Lorde's vocals locate \"different levels of intimacy in different vocal timbres, multi-tracking her voice so that it often sounds like songs are being delivered by competing versions of herself\". According to NME, different personae of Lorde, ranging from the \"strong, composed young woman\" to the hidden \"psycho\", are showcased through her vocal performances on the album. Melodrama is built around Antonoff's signature production, which incorporates drums, synths, layered vocals and straightforward hooks. Lorde and Antonoff met in early 2014 at a Grammy after-party and later had several \"exploratory\" writing sessions before Lorde hired him as the main co-writer on the album. Lorde worked on Melodrama in Antonoff's Rough Customer Studios in New York City and at her home in New Zealand. The song structures on the record are traditional in construction, with piano-based melodies in contrast with the hip-hop influences on Lorde's first album. The singer took a classicist approach, usually composing a melody and then trying different vocal falsettos; Lorde said that because of this, the whole album can be played in acoustic form. She also cited her desire to explore a \"cathartic mode\" for the album. Several publications noted its maximalist pop production, a departure from the singer's signature minimalist style. Melodrama has been described by critics as a pop, electropop, and art pop record. The album's lyrics are about heartbreak and solitude. Though it has been denied by Lorde, music critics have described Melodrama as a loose concept album. Lorde has stated that the record has only a loose narrative; it follows the framework of a single house party, and the events and moods that ensue. According to the singer, the album's shift in narrative focuses on \"I\" in contrast with Pure Heroine's inclusion of \"we\" and \"us\". Lorde wanted to showcase contrast, going from \"big and grand\" to \"really tiny and intimate\", as well as desired to reference personal events, headlines and themes associated with the World Wide Web. She drew inspiration from Paul Simon's 1986 album Graceland, describing it as \"enlightenment after love lost\". Lorde uses numerous metaphors on Melodrama, such as the teeth of great white sharks, continuing her incorporation of teeth in her lyrics. The singer also cites the 1975, especially their song \"Somebody Else\", as inspiration stating: \"It influenced the tones and the colors and the emotions\" of the album. In addition, Fleetwood Mac, Leonard Cohen, Don Henley, Tom Petty, Phil Collins and Joni Mitchell were also noted inspirations. ## Songs\n\n","prompt":"What main studio did Lorde use to work on Melodrama in New York City?","answer":"Rough Customer Studios","generation":"Lorde worked on her album \"Melodrama\" at Electric Lady Studios in New York City.","run_id":"task_1_run_11","is_correct":false,"is_hallucinated":true}

Between 4500 and 3800 BCE, it saw a widespread change in lifestyle as the communities living in the British Isles adopted agriculture as their primary form of subsistence, abandoning the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that had characterised the preceding Mesolithic period. This came about through contact with continental European societies; it is unclear to what extent this can be attributed to an influx of migrants or to indigenous Mesolithic Britons adopting agricultural technologies from the continent. The region of modern Kent would have been key for the arrival of continental European settlers and visitors, because of its position on the estuary of the River Thames and its proximity to the continent.\n\nBritain was then largely forested; widespread forest clearance did not occur in Kent until the Late Bronze Age (c.1000 to 700 BCE). Environmental data from the vicinity of the White Horse Stone, a putatively prehistoric monolith near the River Medway, supports the idea that the area was still largely forested in the Early Neolithic, covered by a woodland of oak, ash, hazel\/alder and amygdaloideae. Throughout most of Britain, there is little evidence of cereal or permanent dwellings from this period, leading archaeologists to believe that the island's Early Neolithic economy was largely pastoral, relying on herding cattle, with people living a nomadic or semi-nomadic life.\n\n","prompt":"What was the primary subsistence form adopted by communities in the British Isles during the Early Neolithic period?","answer":"agriculture","generation":"During the Early Neolithic period in the British Isles, the primary form of subsistence adopted by communities was mixed farming.

In response, 58 Democratic members of the state House boycotted part of the session and left the capitol to deprive the body of a quorum, preventing the Republican-led chamber from functioning. House Speaker Tom Craddick ordered the arrest of the missing lawmakers. 53 of those members, later known as the \"Killer D's,\" fled to a Holiday Inn in Ardmore, Oklahoma to continue depriving the House of a quorum, attracting the attention of national media, as well as Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives, who praised their actions. The efforts later received support from the state's Hispanic chambers of commerce. After the regular session ended, Republican governor Rick Perry called a special session to address redistricting. House Democrats were unable to stage another walkout during the first special session, but Senate Democrats were able to filibuster the bill until the end of the session, even garnering the support of Republican Senator Bill Ratliff. Knowing that Perry would immediately call a second special session after the end of the first, scheduling the session such that they could not filibuster the redistricting package, eleven Democratic members of the Texas Senate (the entire Democratic minority except for Ken Armbrister) chartered a plane and flew to Albuquerque, New Mexico prior to the beginning of the session to prevent a quorum. The \"Texas Eleven,\" as they were called, received support from Democrats across the country, as some members moved to other states to continue their quorum-bust. Senate Republicans changed the chamber's rules to remove the quorum requirements, attempting to lure Democrats back to the state to fight the changes in court. Democrats were unable to block the redistricting package during a third special session, but they staged a symbolic walkout as the package neared passage to delay it over the weekend. After this brief delay, the state Senate passed the redistricting bill, ending the six-month-long redistricting process. The Justice Department granted the maps preclearance, but only after its professional staff's objections had been overruled by the department's political appointees. Federal courts allowed the maps to be used for the 2004 elections, but Democrats intended to appeal it to the Supreme Court.

It developed due to an increase in the Madden–Julian oscillation (MJO), which moved eastward across the Indian Ocean. The same system spawned a disturbance in the northern Indian Ocean that later struck Oman as a tropical cyclone. Such simultaneous systems in opposite hemispheres occasionally occur in the spring or autumn; in May 2002, the powerful MJO pulse produced two such sets of storms, later producing a set in the eastern Indian Ocean that became a deep depression that struck Myanmar and Tropical Storm Errol to the southwest of Indonesia. On April 30, Météo-France (MFR) classified the system as a zone of disturbed weather. It slowly organized, prompting the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) to issue a tropical cyclone formation alert late on May 2, around the time that MFR classified it as Tropical Disturbance 14. The thunderstorms became more concentrated around an increasingly well-defined center, and with minimal wind shear, the system strengthened into Tropical Depression 14 on May 3.

It was originally recorded in 2003, shortly after the recording sessions concluded for Rise Against's second album Revolutions per Minute. When producer Bill Stevenson heard the song, he asked McIlrath to put it on the album. Although the band members enjoyed the song, they questioned how an acoustic ballad could fit in an album characterized by its hardcore sound. Ultimately, the song was shelved. A year later, Fearless Records approached Rise Against about contributing to the Punk Goes Acoustic compilation album, and the band felt that \"Swing Life Away would be an appropriate song for the album.\n\nThe Punk Goes Acoustic version of \"Swing Life Away\" attracted little attention from fans, and McIlrath believed that the song had \"died out\". When Rise Against signed with Dreamworks Records in late 2003, a Dreamworks executive told the band that they should rerecord the song for their upcoming album, Siren Song of the Counter Culture, to which the band agreed to. When brought to producer Garth Richardson, he felt that the song was incomplete, commenting: \"It's just too short. It's almost like a jingle and it needs another part.\" McIlrath decided to elaborate on the song, and used one of Sheryl Crow's guitars he found in the studio to add an instrumental bridge.

The album was produced by Jim O'Rourke, who mixed Foxtrot and was a member of Wilco side project Loose Fur. O'Rourke encouraged lead singer Jeff Tweedy to develop his guitar skills for the album; Tweedy recently became the lead guitarist for the band due to the dismissal of Jay Bennett after the Yankee Hotel Foxtrot recording sessions. Tweedy sought to play solos on the album that were unlike those of jam bands such as Phish and The Grateful Dead. Instead, he performed composed solos influenced by Television such as the one during the coda of \"At Least That's What You Said\". Tweedy refers to the guitar solo at the end of the track as a \"musical transcription\" of one of his panic attacks. A Ghost Is Born was recorded in a manner different from Foxtrot or 1999's Summerteeth; whereas those recordings were performed live in the studio and then extensively de-constructed and arranged in Pro Tools, A Ghost Is Born was first performed live, edited and arranged in Pro Tools, and then performed and re-recorded with minimal overdubbing. Tweedy was excited about writing an album this way: > All those things you can do with Pro Tools and all the emotional buttons you can push with just purely sonic things I think can be done with just plain old music. I love all the possibilities that modern recording techniques allow, but I couldn't picture the idea of really wowing anyone with some crazy evolution of the Yankee Hotel Foxtrot sound.

The first part of the song begins as a ballad which references belief systems and atheism which after 3 minutes, fades out. The second part consists of electronic drones and noise, intended to audibly represent the migraines that lead singer Jeff Tweedy had been suffering from while addicted to pain killers during the recording sessions for A Ghost Is Born. For the song, each band member created a synthesizer noise that mimicked an electronic sound. The installations were simultaneously activated in the room and recorded.

It, along with two species of forest bats and two species of frogs, is one of the archipelago's five endemic animal species. The Guadeloupe woodpecker is present on the main island from sea level to the upper tree line, at around 1,000 m (39,000 in) altitude, but is historically more common on island of Basse-Terre, where it has a preference for the island's east coast, than on Grande-Terre. It is absent from the dependencies of Guadeloupe (Îles des Saintes, Marie-Galante, and La Désirade). The Guadeloupe woodpecker, an exclusively stationary species,, is found in a wide variety of forest types across the islands: it is most common in the tropical rainforest areas of Basse-Terre; in 1998, these rainforests had more than 70 percent of the population of the species in Guadeloupe, 5 percent were in deciduous areas, while the deciduous forests of Grande-Terre hosted about 20 percent, and the mangrove and swamp in the center of the archipelago held the remaining 5 percent. In 2008, a study of Guadeloupean avifauna showed the presence of the Guadeloupe woodpecker in all zones of Guadeloupe National Park, where it prefers Côte-au-vent, the ombrophile massif on the eastern coast of the island, as well as the northwestern zone towards Deshaies north of the Côte-sous-le-vent. The species also seems to have colonized the Caribbean Mountains at the southern tip of Basse-Terre between 1998 and 2007. In 2008, Basse-Terre hosted three-quarters of the population of woodpeckers in the archipelago and Grande-Terre the other quarter. The Guadeloupe woodpecker is a territorial bird but not particularly aggressive towards other birds, with which it seldom interacts.

It was so disliked that Kit Harington joked that when he annoys Benioff and Weiss, they threaten to release the episode on YouTube. Weiss said of the viewing: \"Watching them watch the pilot was a deeply humiliating, painful experience, because these are very smart individuals, and it just clearly wasn’t working for any of them on a very basic level.\" For example, it was never established that Jaime and Cersei Lannister were in fact brother and sister, a major plot point.\n\nHBO did not make a decision for four months after the pilot was delivered. In March 2010, HBO's decision to greenlight the series was announced, with the production of the series scheduled to start June 2010. HBO however demanded the first episode be reshot, and wanted all the scenes from Morocco scrapped. A cameo appearance by George R.R. Martin as a Pentoshi nobleman at Daenerys's wedding filmed in Morocco was therefore also cut. Around 90 percent of the pilot was re-shot in 2010, with some cast changes and a different director.\n\n ### Aired episode\n\nThe original pilot remains unaired, although some footage from it was used in the first aired episode. This includes Sansa's scenes with Catelyn (Michelle Fairley's footage as Catelyn was inserted over Jennifer Ehle's performance), Will's ride through the woods (retained though also portrayed by a different actor), most of the feast at Winterfell, and Ned and Robert's scene in the crypt.

The planet was discovered by the radial velocity method, using the HARPS apparatus in June 2008. It is the most massive of the six proposed planets in the system. The planet is of interest as this star has relatively low metallicity, supporting a hypothesis that different metallicities in protostars determine what kind of planets they will form.\n\n ## Discovery\n\nHD 40307 d was discovered through the Doppler spectroscopy method, which functions by measuring the variations in radial velocity in a star produced by the gravitational effect of orbiting exoplanets. The radial velocities were measured by the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher spectrography system (HARPS) at the La Silla Observatory in Chile's Atacama Desert. The other less massive planets orbiting HD 40307 were discovered in the same way: HD 40307 b and HD 40307 c first, and then HD 40307 e, HD 40307 f, and HD 40307 g. The discovery of HD 40307 d and the former two was announced at the astrophysics conference that took place on June 16–18, 2008 in Nantes, France.\n\n ## Orbit and mass\n\nHD 40307 d has a mass of at least 9.2 times Earth's; assuming that all planets in the system have coplanar orbits, it is the most massive planet known in the system. The planet orbits approximately 0.135 astronomical units from its primary star, as compared to Earth's orbit at approximately one astronomical unit away from the Sun. As a result, one year on HD 40307 d constitutes approximately 20.45 Earth days. The eccentricity of the planet's orbit was found to not differ significantly from zero, meaning that there is insufficient data to distinguish the orbit from an entirely circular one.\n\nThe star around which HD 40307 d orbits has an unusually low metallicity compared to that of other planet-bearing stars. This supports a hypothesis concerning the possibility that the metallicity of stars during their births may determine whether a protostar's accretion disk forms gas giants or terrestrial planets.\n\n ## Characteristics\n\nThe planet has not been found to transit and, further, it is not likely to. It has also not been imaged. More specific physical characteristics such as radius, composition, and average surface temperature cannot be observed.\n\nA dynamical study of planets b, c, and d showed tidal effects at least on b and c, to the extent that b had to be a sub-Neptune. All the planets from b to at least f must have migrated inward. That study implied that d was a sub-Neptune as well.\n\nAs such strong tidal forces often result in the destruction of larger natural satellites in planets orbiting close to a star, it is unlikely that HD 40307 d hosts any satellites.\n\n ## See also\n\n- Mini-Neptune","prompt":"What is the method used to discover HD 40307 d?","answer":"Doppler spectroscopy method","generation":"HD 40307 d was discovered using the radial velocity method. This technique detects exoplanets by observing the Doppler shifts in the spectrum of the star around which the planet orbits.

For Keen Dreams, the team reprised their roles, and used the game as a prototype for what they wanted to change for the next Keen games for Apogee: an increase in graphical quality with parallax scrolling to make the background move at a different speed than the foreground, a pseudo-3D view rather than a side-on view, ramps rather than solely flat surfaces, support for sound cards, and changes to the design based on player feedback. The game's plot, as a result, was designed to be a standalone game outside of the continuity of the main series, and not a true sequel. For Vorticons, Carmack had created adaptive tile refresh to produce a scrolling effect on computers not powerful enough to redraw the entire screen when the player moved. For Keen Dreams, he wanted to scroll the background at a different rate than the foreground, but again computers of the time were not powerful enough to do so smoothly. Instead, he had them scroll at the same rate, and came up with a plan to save combinations of overlapping foreground and background elements in memory and display the appropriate combination for where Keen was on the screen, so that the game only needed to pick the correct image rather than keep track of both the foreground and background. Hall, meanwhile, had received feedback from parents who did not like that the enemies in Vorticons left behind corpses instead of disappearing like in other games; he did not want the violence to have no effects, and so in Dreams replaced the raygun with pellets that temporarily stunned enemies. He was not satisfied with this change, and for the next games added in a stun gun instead. He also removed the pogo stick from the game, both to symbolize that Keen was in a nightmare and therefore felt less empowered, and also to make designing the levels easier as vertical motion did not need to be as accounted for. Once the game engine and design changes were completed, Keen Dreams was completed in less than a month even as the team simultaneously worked on another game. The level maps were designed by Tom Hall and John Romero, using a custom-made program called Tile Editor v5.0 (TED5), which they used for the entire Keen series as well as several other games. Bobby Prince had planned out an introductory cinematic with an accompanying song titled \"Eat Your Vegetables\", but it was rejected as it would have made the game too large to fit on a single floppy disk. The story introduction was instead done in plain text, and \"Eat Your Vegetables\" was repurposed as stage music for Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy.","prompt":"What item was removed from \"Keen Dreams\" to symbolize that Keen was in a nightmare and feel less empowered?","answer":"The pogo stick.","generation":"In \"Keen Dreams,\" an item that was removed to symbolize that Keen was in a nightmare and to make him feel less empowered was his iconic pogo stick.

In the installation, a cage-like structure hangs from the ceiling and casts quadrilateral shadows onto the ground. Kaabi-Linke drew inspiration from a bridge in Venice where Arab and African street vendors used carpets to show counterfeit wares. The work was shown at the 54th Venice Biennale and was later purchased by the New York Guggenheim Museum in 2016 as part of the Guggenheim UBS MAP Global Art Initiative.

In May 2012, Kaabi-Linke exhibited in \"Chkoun Ahna\" at the Tunisian National Museum of Carthage. The show, co-curated by her partner, focused on questions of Tunisian identity following the 2010 Jasmine Revolution.

The funds held in the 'B Account' serve as a buffer against the volatility of the 'A Account' returns; i.e., during years when there are no returns or low returns. The funds in the 'B Account' can be accessed by the Tuvalu Government, which refers to the funds in the 'B Account' in the Budget as the Consolidated Investment Fund (CIF), which can be drawn down into the consolidated revenue account as an additional source of revenue for expenditure on government services through the recurrent budget. There is no specific language in the agreement that established the Tuvalu Trust Fund as to the minimum balance of the 'B Account'. There has been a debate about how much of a buffer is sufficient. The board of the fund have settled on a target CIF balance of 16 percent of the maintained value of the fund. The Tuvalu Trust Fund was established with a management structure that was designed to avoid the mismanagement and corruption that has plagued many other Pacific trust funds. One important element of the Tuvalu Trust Fund is that it is structured to avoid overdrawing to fund unauthorised projects. This is achieved through the separation of fund capital from fund proceeds available for distribution. The success of the Tuvalu Trust Fund is attributed by Brian Bell, a member of the Tuvalu Trust Fund Advisory Committee from its inception in 1987 to 2002, to the following factors: accountability through a Board of four directors with Tuvalu in the chair and the other original parties providing members; the use of professional funds management to provide investment advice; the monitoring of the performance of the fund by actuarial consultants (the Fund Monitor); the auditing of the fund by international auditors; and an advisory committee to monitor Tuvalu's economic performance and provide advice to the Government and the Board.","prompt":"What is the target CIF balance set by the board of the Tuvalu Trust Fund as a percentage of the maintained value of the fund?","answer":"16 percent","generation":"The target Capital Investment Fund (CIF) balance set by the board of the Tuvalu Trust Fund is 16% of the maintained value of the fund.

West commissioned the video to be directed by Japanese contemporary artist Takashi Murakami. He had been enlisted by West to oversee the art direction of Graduation and was behind the cover art designs for the album and its accompanying singles. The collaboration first came about when West visited Murakami's Kaikai Kiki Co. studio in Roppongi Hills during a brief trip to Tokyo, Japan in the midst of touring the year prior. Regarding his joint collaboration with the artist, West remarked, \"Murakami, his work has been stunning to me because pop art is really expressive, representative and expressive and emotional, and it looks like something you can do yourself. [But] you cannot do no Murakami shit yourself. You cannot do this at home. He has this studio out in Japan that has 30 artists working at one time. I love Japanese culture and I was always into art, and Murakmi is a god in the art world.\" The short animated feature expresses glossy, colorful pastel imagery that take cues from Superflat, a post-modern art movement influenced by Japanese manga and animé which was founded by Murakami. Often called \"the Warhol of Japan,\" Murakami's surrealistic visual art is characterized by cartoonish creatures which appear friendly and cheerful at first glance, but possess dark, twisted undertones. The artistic concept involves a fantastic, grotesque and sometimes dark universe of creatures like \"Mr. Dob,\" \"Smiley-Face Flowers,\" and colorful mushrooms. The three-dimensional art technique blends artistry with Japanese anime and launched Murakami to fame in the 1990s. It also attracted the attention of Marc Jacobs, creative director of Louis Vuitton, who recruited Muramki to revise the traditional LV monogram brand logo for their line of handbags and accessories. The commercially successful venture paved the way for Murakami's artwork to cross over into commerce and other mediums, propelling him into an internationally recognized artist. For the music video, the technicolor album artwork that Murakami designed for Graduation are brought to life through the use of cel-shaded animation. Its narrative also contains numerous visual and thematic references to the sci-fi film Back to the Future.","prompt":"Who directed the music video for Kanye West's song \"Good Morning\"?","answer":"Takashi Murakami","generation":"The music video for Kanye West's song \"Good Morning\" was directed by the Japanese contemporary artist Takashi Murakami.","run_id":"task_1_run_13","is_correct":true,"is_hallucinated":false}

Moreover, separate multiple attachments are not that uncommon.\n\nAccording to some authors, who use the original description by Treitz, the muscle may be divided into two sections: a ligamentous portion attaching the right crus of diaphragm to the connective tissue surrounding the coeliac artery and superior mesenteric artery; and a lower muscular portion from the connective tissue attaching to the duodenum. The superior portion is also described as the Hilfsmuskel. These two parts are now considered anatomically distinct, with the suspensory muscle referring solely to the lower structure attaching at the duodenum.\n\n ## Function\n\nThe ligament contains a slender band of skeletal muscle from the diaphragm and a fibromuscular band of smooth muscle from the horizontal and ascending parts of the duodenum. When it contracts, by virtue of connections to the third and fourth parts of the duodenum, the suspensory muscle of the duodenum widens the angle of the duodenojejunal flexure, allowing movement of the intestinal contents.\n\n ### Embryology\n\nEmbryologically, the suspensory muscle of the duodenum is derived from mesoderm.

The engine was first proposed in 1989, while the first game to use it, Lure of the Temptress, was released in 1992, followed by Beneath a Steel Sky (1994), Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars (1996) and Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror (1997).\n\nIt allowed in-game characters to wander around the gameworld independently of each other, performing \"everyday life\" actions, which was not previously possible, and all characters and objects occupied space; consequently, non-player characters had to side-step the player's protagonist and any other object they came across, as well as the player having to side-step them, achieving a more realistic game world that previous engines were unable to provide, though non-player characters could unwittingly block a path as the player was traversing the game scene. Non-player characters performed much simpler tasks with each release due to size constraints.\n\nTwo games (Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars and Broken Sword II: The Smoking Mirror) that use a Virtual Theatre variant engine can now be played on modern hardware using ScummVM, which as a result allows the engine to run on platforms where the titles were not officially released. In 2012, it was confirmed that the engine would be revived as \"Virtual Theatre 7\" for the fifth Broken Sword titled Broken Sword: The Serpent's Curse (2013).\n\n","prompt":"What was the first game released that used the Virtual Theatre engine?","answer":"Lure of the Temptress","generation":"The first game released that used the Virtual Theatre engine was \"Lure of the Temptress,\" developed by Revolution Software.

They first visit the Utica branch, where former Scranton employee Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones) is now regional manager. Pam, who is engaged to Karen's ex-boyfriend Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), fears the encounter will be awkward. However, she is pleasantly surprised upon learning Karen is now married and pregnant, and the two get along very well – when Pam reveals her and Jim's engagement, Karen even offers genuine congratulations. Michael's lecture in Utica proves to be a disaster when he pretends to receive a call saying that his father has died, has Pam throw miniature sized Mounds at the audience, and tries to teach the employees a trick for how to memorize names but ends up insulting everybody. Nevertheless, Pam is ecstatic to have found closure with Karen. Later, on the road, Michael tells Pam that he never found closure with Holly and, at Pam's suggestion, they decide to blow off the other lectures and drive to Nashua to find Holly. Back in Scranton, Jim and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) have been named the reluctant heads of the Party Planning Committee by Michael due to previous fights between Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) and Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey). Jim and Dwight prove terrible at the job, and when an upset Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) chastises them for forgetting her birthday, they try to make it up to her by throwing a party but they do a poor job - Dwight chooses brown and gray balloons (because they \"match the carpet\") and doesn't blow them up all the way, uses toilet paper as streamers, and his banner simply states \"IT IS YOUR BIRTHDAY.\" Jim does just as poorly when he cannot get anyone to contribute money, forgets Kelly's age, and how to spell her name.

The oldest complete score, dating from about 1716, is an error-strewn manuscript that may be a copy from one or more of the performing scores from that period. The manuscript bears numerous notes and corrections in Handel's hand, and was possibly the basis for the substantial revisions which he effected in 1731. It was also used by the copyist John Christopher Smith to produce two performing scores for the 1720s Hamburg performances. Further complete manuscript copies were produced by Smith and others in 1725–28 (the \"Malmesbury\" score), 1740 (\"Lennard\") and 1745 (\"Granville\"). These provide many variations of individual numbers.\n\nDuring the initial run at the Queen's Theatre the publisher John Walsh printed Songs in the Opera of Rinaldo, in mainly short score form. Apart from the overture, instrumental numbers were omitted, as were the recitatives. In June 1711 Walsh published a fuller version, which included instrumental parts; he continued to publish versions of individual numbers, with a variety of orchestrations, until the 1730s. In 1717 William Babell issued an arrangement for harpsichord of the overture and seven of the arias. Friedrich Chrysander published editions of the whole opera in 1874 and in 1894, based on a study of the existing published and manuscript material. In 1993 David Kimbell, for the Hallische Händel-Ausgabe (HHA), produced a full score of the 1711 version, together with rejected draft material and the additional numbers introduced in revivals up to 1717. HHA has also produced a complete score of the 1731 version.\n\nThe libretto was published in London by the Queen's Theatre in February 1711, to coincide with the premiere, with Hill's English translation. Revised versions followed in 1717 and 1731 to reflect the changes introduced in those years; Rossi is believed to have prepared the Italian additions and revisions, with the 1731 English credited to \"Mr. Humphreys\".

Handel often reused and adapted his own music or even borrowed musical material from other composers, as was common at the time. While the specific sources for the revisions in 1731 aren't always explicitly documented, Handel’s general practice included rearranging existing arias, altering orchestrations, and adding new compositions that could enhance the overall impact of the opera for contemporary audiences.","run_id":"task_1_run_14","is_correct":false,"is_hallucinated":true}

They are an informal group unified only by their reliance on marine environments for feeding. Despite the diversity in anatomy seen between groups, improved foraging efficiency has been the main driver in their evolution. The level of dependence on the marine environment varies considerably with species. For example, dolphins and whales are completely dependent on the marine environment for all stages of their life; seals feed in the ocean but breed on land; and polar bears must feed on land. The cetaceans became aquatic around 50 million years ago (mya). Based on molecular and morphological research, the cetaceans genetically and morphologically fall firmly within the Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates). The term \"Cetartiodactyla\" reflects the idea that whales evolved within the ungulates. The term was coined by merging the name for the two orders, Cetacea and Artiodactyla, into a single word. Under this definition, the closest living land relative of the whales and dolphins is thought to be the hippopotamuses. Sirenians, the sea cows, became aquatic around 40 million years ago. The first appearance of sirenians in the fossil record was during the early Eocene, and by the late Eocene, sirenians had significantly diversified. Inhabitants of rivers, estuaries, and nearshore marine waters, they were able to spread rapidly. The most primitive sirenian, †Prorastomus, was found in Jamaica, unlike other marine mammals which originated from the Old World (such as cetaceans). The first known quadrupedal sirenian was †Pezosiren from the early middle Eocene. The earliest known sea cows, of the families †Prorastomidae and †Protosirenidae, were both confined to the Eocene, and were pig-sized, four-legged, amphibious creatures. The first members of Dugongidae appeared by the middle Eocene. At this point, sea cows were fully aquatic. Pinnipeds split from other caniforms 50 mya during the Eocene.

It had an associated circulation and rainbands to the east of the center, and was related to the monsoon trough. The system was located within an area of warm sea surface temperatures of over 29 °C (84 °F) and steadily decreasing wind shear. A ridge to the south caused the system to initially track to the north. By February 16, the system had moved over Mozambique and turned to the east, although by that time it had become better organized with the convection wrapping into the center. Subsequently, the system moved southward due to a weakness in the ridge, with conditions favorable for tropical cyclogenesis such as low wind shear and good divergence. On February 18, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert, and at 1200 UTC that day, Météo-France (MFR) initiated advisories on Tropical Disturbance 09. Upon being classified, the disturbance had a broad circulation that was difficult to locate, with moderate convection in its eastern periphery. The thunderstorms organized further, and MFR upgraded the disturbance to a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on February 19. Three hours later, the JTWC began issuing advisories on Tropical Cyclone 16S, and at 0600 UTC that day, MFR upgraded the depression to a moderate tropical storm after an advanced scatterometer indicated winds of over 65 km\/h (40 mph); as a result, the National Weather Service of Madagascar gave it the name Haruna.

It was later named Certhia australasiana by George Shaw in 1812, Melithreptus melanoleucus by Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot in 1817, and Meliphaga inornata by John Gould in 1838. The generic term comes from the French phylidonyre, which combines the names for a honeyeater and a sunbird (previously thought to belong to the same family). The specific epithet is derived from the Ancient Greek stems pyrrhos meaning 'fire' and pteron meaning 'wing', in reference to the yellow wing patches. Some guidebooks have the binomial name written as Phylidonyris pyrrhoptera; however, a review in 2001 ruled that the genus name was masculine, hence pyrrhopterus is the correct specific name. Two subspecies are recognised: the nominate form P.p. pyrrhopterus over most of its range; and P.p. halmaturinus, which is restricted to Kangaroo Island and the Mount Lofty Ranges. A 2004 molecular study showed its close relatives to be the New Holland honeyeater and the white-cheeked honeyeater, the three forming the now small genus Phylidonyris. A 2017 genetic study using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA found the white-streaked honeyeater to also lie within the clade. The ancestor of the crescent honeyeater diverged from the lineage giving rise to the white-streaked, New Holland and white-cheeked honeyeaters around 7.5 million years ago. DNA analysis has shown honeyeaters to be related to the Pardalotidae (pardalotes), Acanthizidae (Australian warblers, scrubwrens, thornbills, etc.), and Maluridae (Australian fairy-wrens) in the large superfamily Meliphagoidea. \"Crescent honeyeater\" has been designated as the official common name for the species by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC).

This street was subsequently extended to the west in a plan created by General James White four years later. In 1945, the city of Knoxville commissioned a plan which recommended that a series of freeways be constructed throughout the city to relieve traffic congestion on surface streets. These freeways were intended to be integrated into the then-proposed nationwide network of freeways that later became the Interstate Highway System, which at the time, was expected to eventually be authorized by Congress. At the same time, the University of Tennessee and the city of Knoxville were looking to relieve game-day traffic congestion around Neyland Stadium, which was then called Shields–Watkins Field. On October 23, 1950, Tennessee Governor Gordon Browning instructed state highway commissioner Charles F. Wayland Jr. to begin work on a two-lane extension of Front Street, initially known as Lakefront Drive, to Kingston Pike. This road, which was renamed Neyland Drive along with Front Avenue, was constructed the following year, opening to traffic on September 29, 1951. A wooden bridge on the original Front Avenue portion of Neyland Drive over Second Creek was replaced with a corrugated steel-structured bridge with an asphalt deck between February and March 1955. In 1951, a preliminary concept was drawn up for a freeway loop around downtown, which included upgrading part of Neyland Drive. The northern portion of this loop included part of the Magnolia Avenue Expressway, which became part of Interstate 40 after the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 was passed. On January 10, 1957, a proposal for a square-shaped freeway loop called the Downtown Loop was presented to the Knoxville Metropolitan Planning Commission. Engineering work began in August 1957, and the design for this freeway was jointly approved on July 17, 1958, by the Bureau of Public Roads, predecessor to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA); and the Tennessee Department of Highways, now the Tennessee Department of Transportation (TDOT).

Schools in Malta generally begin their school day at 8:30am and finish at 2:40pm. Students receive three days of holidays in November 15 days of holidays over Christmas, two days of holidays in March and eight days of holidays in April, in addition to public holidays. Maltese school students receive the highest number of days off of all school students in Europe, with 90 days during the 2010–11 academic year being non-school days. This is 14 days more than the European average of 76. Virtually all Maltese state schools run tuck shops, while some secondary schools are home to cafeterias.\n\nState schools provide textbooks free of charge to their students, while private schools generally require their students to pay for their textbooks, enabling the latter to change their textbooks and textbook editions more frequently. All primary schools have at least four computers, one printer, a large monitor and a teacher's laptop computer in their classrooms, while many secondary schools have specialised rooms necessary to teach subjects such as Home Economics and Food Technology. An average of 22.5 students are enrolled per primary school class, with the average rising to 24.3 in secondary school classes. Primary school teachers are expected to dedicate five hours per week to each of Maltese, English and mathematics, one hour per week to science, two hours per weeks to arts and crafts, two hours per week to social studies, one hour and 15 minutes per week to social studies, and two and a half hours per week to physical education and religion. State school syllabi at the secondary level are set by the local examination bodies.\n\n ### Tertiary education\n\nUnder the Education Act of 1988, the Government of Malta is obligated to provide free university education to eligible residents with sufficient qualifications for entry. However, due to funding constraints, the University of Malta offers some courses only every other year in order to maximise course offerings with optimum funding usage. 10,000 students currently study at the university.

Calls can also vary seasonally. During the hot, rainy season, the loud, raucous calls that are a hallmark of ruffed lemurs allow groups to remain in contact and maintain spacing. These loud calls can be heard up to 1 kilometre (0.6 mi) away. Ruffed lemurs use alarm calls that differentiate between ground and aerial predators. For instance an abrupt roar or huff alerts the group to an avian predator, and a pulsed squawk or growl-snort communicates the existence of a mammalian ground predator. When sounding these calls, such as the pulsed squawk, adults direct them at the predator after moving to a safe position. Once the alarm call is sounded by one individual, the resulting chorus can even reach the furthest ranging community members. In captivity, ruffed lemur vocalizations have been studied and divided into three general groups: high-, medium-, and low-amplitude calls. The well-known roar\/shriek chorus is spontaneous, occurring most often during period of high activity, as well as being contagious, involving communal participation including infants three to four months old. Abrupt roars are also more common during high activity and aside from alerting group members to the presence of an avian predator, they probably also help maintain contact with individuals outside of visual range or indicate an aggressive\/defensive response to a disturbance. In the wild, both of these calls are emitted more during the hot, rainy season due to heighten activity. All high-amplitude calls are delivered with from a \"taut\" body posture. Medium-amplitude calls operate over a shorter range or often involve moderately arousing situations, such as frustration or submission. Low-amplitude calls also generally operate over a short range, yet also cover a wider range of aggravation levels. Whines are highly variable between individual ruffed lemurs. Cough, grumble, squeak, and squeal have only been observed and researched in the wild. The calls of ruffed lemurs vary only slightly between the two species. In fact, in captivity, it has been documented that red ruffed lemurs understand and even join in the alarm calls of black-and-white ruffed lemurs. One minor difference between the vocal repertoires of these two species is in the pulse rate and frequency of the pulsed squawk, which is much faster and higher in red ruffed lemurs than in black-and-white ruffed lemurs. The difference in this vocalization is only interspecific, showing no signs of significant sexual dimorphism within each species. In black-and-white ruffed lemurs, pulsed squawks sometimes slow down as the group calms down, and integrate with the wail, creating pulsed squawk-wail intermediates .","prompt":"What is the maximum distance ruffed lemur calls can be heard?","answer":"1 kilometre (0.6 mi)","generation":"Ruffed lemurs are known for their loud and far-reaching calls, which can travel through dense forest environments.

It is about 30 cm (12 in) in length and weighs about 200 to 220 g (7.1 to 7.8 oz). It is found in tropical rainforests, near its preferred habitat of rocky outcrops. The female's plumage is brownish \/ dark smokey grey in colour, and generally less noticeable than the males because of their nesting work in rocky areas. The male's feathers are a bright orange. Both have a heavy body, broad-based bill and wear a remarkable half-moon crest on the head. It is one of two species of the genus Rupicola, the other being the Andean cock-of-the-rock. The Guianan cock-of-the-rock lives across the forested region of northeastern South America. Its diet consists mostly of fruit, but they sometimes feast on small snakes and lizards.\n\nThe Guianan cock-of-the-rock breeds in the early months of the year and, on average, the female lays her eggs around March. The females choose a mate by flying down to the ground and pecking the male on his rump. The male then turns around and the mating takes place almost immediately. During the height of the mating season, males engage in competitive displays in lek, which is a complex courting behaviour that is done to attract females. Males and females live separately except when the females choose a mate. The mating success varies based on multiple factors, ranging from the plumage exhibited by a male to the composition of the lek itself. There is speculation that the male-male competition is an important factor in lek formation and breeding.

It consists predominantly of volcanoes that formed subglacially during the Late Pleistocene age, such as Pali Dome, Slag Hill, Ring Mountain and Ember Ridge, but activity continued at Pali Dome and Slag Hill into the Holocene epoch. The Mount Cayley volcanic field is part of the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, which in turn represents a northern extension of the Cascade Volcanic Arc. Volcanism of the Cascade Arc is largely a result of the Juan de Fuca Plate sliding under the North American Plate at the Cascadia subduction zone. Three main summits comprise the Mount Cayley massif. The highest and northernmost is Mount Cayley with an elevation of 2,385 m (7,825 ft). Its northeastern flank abuts the southern end of the Powder Mountain Icefield. This is a 9 km (5.6 mi) long and 5 km (3.1 mi) wide irregularly-shaped glacier that trends slightly to the northwest. Just southwest of Mount Cayley lies Pyroclastic Peak, 2,341 m (7,680 ft) in elevation. It contains a jagged summit ridge of many slender rock pinnacles, the largest of which is known as the Vulcan's Thumb. Wizard Peak with an elevation of 2,240 m (7,350 ft) is east of Pyroclastic Peak and is the lowest of the three main summits. As a stratovolcano, Mount Cayley is built up of solidified lava and ash from successive volcanic eruptions. It is predominantly dacitic in composition, although rhyodacite is also common. Its original and current volumes remain uncertain. It may have had a volume as large as 13 km<sup>3<\/sup> (3.1 cu mi), but erosion has since reduced it to glacially eroded crags. The modern volcano has an estimated volume of 8 km<sup>3<\/sup> (1.9 cu mi) and is only a modest fraction of its total output of silicic eruptive products. It has a proximal relief of 550 m (1,800 ft) and a draping relief of 2,070 m (6,790 ft), with a nearly vertical cliff more than 500 m (1,600 ft) high immediately above the Turbid Creek valley. Turbid Creek, Dusty Creek, Avalanche Creek and Shovelnose Creek flow from the slopes of Mount Cayley. Deep seismic profiling 12.5 to 13 km (7.8 to 8.1 mi) below the volcano has identified a large bright spot, a reflector interpreted to be a mid-crustal magma chamber or body of very hot rock. Similar mid-crustal reflectors have been identified under subduction zone volcanoes in Japan.","prompt":"What is the name of the highest summit in the Mount Cayley massif?","answer":"Mount Cayley","generation":"The highest summit in the Mount Cayley massif is known as Pyroclastic Peak.","run_id":"task_1_run_15","is_correct":true,"is_hallucinated":false}

Tom Breihan of Stereogum described the song as \"a seriously strong performance, all hard snarls over a bleepy late-'90s-style beat\" and that it \"finds Kanye getting surprisingly personal, at least for a couple of lines, about his long-rumored relationship with Kim Kardashian.\" Rob Markman of MTV stated that \"lyrically, Kanye delivers a fiery performance\" on the track, and that \"it's all pretty intriguing, considering Kanye has shied away from the media for almost two years now.\" Alex Gale of BET mused that the song features a \"brash Kanye West going in furiously over a schizophrenic soundscape from Hit-Boy, the production maestro behind The Throne's 'Niggas in Paris.' Yeezy's bars are buzzworthy to say the least\". DJBooth mused \"arrogance is busting through the seams on the record, yet it is balanced enough to sound charismatic in a form that Mr. West has perfected.\" Rolling Stone wrote that the song was \"surprisingly magnanimous\" and that it features West in his \"full-on braggart mode\".\n\nIn Complex'''s list of the best 25 lines of the first half of 2012, West's line \"And I'll admit, I had fell in love with Kim\/Around the same time she had fell in love with him\/Well that's cool, baby girl, do ya thang\/Lucky I ain't had Jay drop him from the team\" was listed as the second best. \"Cold\" debuted at number 92 on the US Billboard Hot 100, ultimately achieving a peak position of number 86 on the chart.

In response to the line \"Tell PETA my mink is draggin' on the floor\", PETA stated:\n\n> \"What's draggin’ on the floor is Kanye's reputation as a man with no empathy for animals or human beings. He's a great musician but doesn’t seem to have the fashion sense to design anything more than caveman costumes.

The scheme was given the go-ahead in July 2012 as part of the City Deal, whereby local councils would be given greater control over money by the government. There had been calls for the line to reopen, primarily due to traffic congestion on the A369, which is the only route from Portishead to Bristol. A consultation on the reopening plans was held between 22 June and 3 August 2015 to gather views from the community and stakeholders before moving on to detailed designs. Due to the additional capital costs, the line will not be electrified, however the design will include passive provision for future electrification. In April 2019 the Department for Transport committed £31.9m to cover the shortfall in finance for MetroWest Phase 1, meaning that funding has now been secured. In November 2019 North Somerset Council submitted a Development Consent Order (DCO) application to the Planning Inspectorate, which seeks powers to build and operate the disused section of railway from Portishead to Pill, gain environmental consent to undertake works to the existing freight railway through the Avon Gorge and obtain powers for the compulsory acquisition of land. The Secretary of State for Transport is expected to make a decision within 18 months. Subject to final business case approval, construction work had been expected to start on the line in December 2021 and then take around two years to complete. Approval was given again in November 2022. As part of the works, Pill station will be reopened.

The drums and bugles were formally presented to the regiment at the unveiling ceremony, at the conclusion of which the bugles were used to sound the Last Post.

The two memorials are similar, though the OBLI's is more modestly decorated. When the Lancashire Fusiliers were amalgamated with other fusilier regiments into the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers in 1968, the new regiment adopted the memorial and rededicated it to commemorate all fusiliers killed in the line of duty.

As a result, the memorial was moved to the side of Bolton Road, outside the front gate of the former barracks.

AllMusic senior writer Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that while Weezer is essentially \"just punk-pop, delivered without much dynamic range but with a whole lot of hooks\", \"nobody else\" excels at the style as successfully as Weezer does on the album, which he felt ranked among the best rock records of 2001. Rolling Stone described the Green Album as the \"anti-Pinkerton\", with album art and \"squeaky-clean\" production that recalled Weezer's debut. The album was compared to the 1999 film Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace by Rob Mitchum of Pitchfork, who stated \"Both sci-fi epic and alt-rock record were long-awaited events that had even the most jaded hipster hopping around like a small child with a full bladder.\" Neva Chonin of the Houston Chronicle called it \"a sublime selection of power-pop songs with enough lyrical ballast to keep them from floating away on their own euphoria\".

The team's head coach was Dan McGugin, who served his third season in that capacity. Members of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA), the Commodores played seven home games in Nashville, Tennessee at Curry Field, and finished the season with a record of 8–1 overall and 5–0 in SIAA.\n\nThe 1906 Vanderbilt team had one of the best seasons in the school's history, outscoring opponents 278–16. Innis Brown rated the 1906 team as the best the South ever had. Vanderbilt won all of its home games, finishing the season on a 23-game home win streak.

Football was a sport that had degenerated into dangerous tactics such as: the flying wedge, punching, kicking, piling-on, and elbows to the face. Almost any violent behavior was allowed. Fatalities and injuries mounted during the 1905 season.\n\nAs a result, the 1906 season was played under a new set of rules. The rules governing intercollegiate football were changed to promote a more open and less dangerous style of play. An intercollegiate conference, which would become the forerunner of the NCAA, approved radical changes including the legalization of the forward pass, allowing the punting team to recover an on-side kick as a live ball, abolishing the dangerous flying wedge, creating a neutral zone between offense and defense, and doubling the first-down distance to 10 yards, to be gained in three downs.\n\n ## Schedule\n\n ## Season summary\n\n ### Week 1: Kentucky State\n\nSources:\n\nIn a 28–0 win over Kentucky State College to open the season, Owsley Manier scored three touchdowns and the Commodores as a whole rushed for 630 yards. G. A. Hall had a 33-yard punt return for a touchdown. The Commodores were penalized several times.

Like McGugin, Mississippi's coach Thomas S. Hammond was a Michigan alumnus. One account reads: \"whatever hopes the spectators had of seeing a close and exciting football game today when Vanderbilt faced Mississippi were shattered in the very first five minutes of play.\" The stars of the contest were Dan Blake and Honus Craig.

This causes mixed feelings among the various characters, particularly Ko, Aoba, and Akaishi (who had also liked Wakaba). Akane soon becomes friends with Ko and Tsukishimas, and begins working in the Tsukishima cafe. As another year begins, the romantic subplots further solidify when Yūhei expresses an interest in Aoba. Meanwhile, Seishu gains a new assistant coach in the form of Yūhei's older brother Junpei, after Ichiyo agrees to marry him if Seishu makes it to Koshien. When the prefectural summer baseball tournament starts, Seishu starts with a dominating shutout against its first-round opponent, Matsunami Municipal High School. In the second round, they face Sena Municipal High School led by Tatsumasa Miki, a former Seishu first-string player, which in the first round defeated the team headed by Seishu's former head coach. Seishu wins with a nearly perfect game, ending Part Two of the story. Part Three starts with the prefectural tournament still in progress. After another win by Seishu, Akane is hospitalized due to an unspecified illness. Initially, Akaishi's play is affected by worrying about Akane's condition. Ko continues to perform well and promises Akane to go on a date with her if Seishu reaches Koshien. However, Akane's illness is more severe than expected, and she is scheduled for surgery on the morning of the prefectural final against Ryuō. Before the game begins, Ko tells Aoba he loves her more than anyone, but in such a way she thinks he is lying until after Seishu wins in extra innings, clinching a Koshien berth. In the final chapter, the morning before traveling to Koshien, Akaishi visits Akane recovering in the hospital and Ko and Aoba head for the train station holding hands. ## Media\n\n","prompt":"Who becomes the new assistant coach for Seishu after Ichiyo agrees to marry him if Seishu makes it to Koshien?","answer":"Junpei","generation":"After Ichiyo agrees to marry him if Seishu makes it to Koshien, Seishu Sawamura's new assistant coach becomes Daigo Shigeno.

Originally there were two helps, which could only be used in order. Starting with the sixth episode, a third option was added, the three helps were given names, and the One could choose any of the three at any point in the game. The helps were, in order:\n\n- \"Poll The Mob\": Originally known as the first help, the One selects one of the three answers to get more information about. The number of Mob members who chose that answer is revealed, and the One chooses one of the revealed Mob members to discuss his or her response.\n- \"Ask The Mob\": Originally known as the second help, two Mob members are randomly selected: one who answered correctly and one who answered incorrectly. Each explains his or her decision to the One, which in turn eliminates the third choice from consideration. If all Mob members chose the same answer, only one Mob member is randomly selected and explains their decision, then the One may decide whether to go for the answer or not.

Three contestants are then introduced, each accompanied by three pieces of baggage: a small one, a medium one, and a large one, with each one containing a corresponding secret. The central contestant also has a piece of baggage of his or her own, which is only revealed at the end of the show. During the show, three possible secrets about the central contestant are given, one of which is the actual secret contained in their baggage. These secrets can include bad habits, strange relationship preferences, issues with one's past, gross hygiene, or strange hobbies. After the three other contestants are introduced, they each open the smallest piece of baggage, and explain the secrets they contain.\n\nIn the second segment, Springer reveals the second piece of baggage, contained in the medium-sized suitcase.

The three contestants are placed on the other side of the stage, along with the central contestant. Only the three contestants know which piece of baggage belongs to whom. The main contestant chooses the piece of baggage which is the \"deal-breaker\" (i.e., the one secret that they cannot accept). After stating this, the contestants then return to the other side of the stage and reveal which suitcase belongs to them. The person who claims the deal breaker baggage is immediately eliminated, and later backstage reveals the largest piece of baggage that would have been shown in the final round. The central contestant and two remaining contestants discuss the secrets in the medium pieces of baggage; the two contestants then plead their cases as to why they should be the central contestant's choice. Springer then asks the two remaining contestants, one at a time, a few questions (usually five or six each) about their personal lives.\n\nThe two contestants then open their largest pieces of baggage and reveal the secrets they contain. Each contestant makes one final statement, and the main contestant eliminates a second contestant.

Moving westward, the disturbance remained relatively weak until 6 September, when it was first classified as a tropical cyclone just west of the Windward Islands.

The nearby Geilo Airport, Dagali, a two-hour drive away, had already made a similar decision, and was in the process of extending its own runway. The airport opened on 31 October 1987.

The increased cost of building a longer runway was estimated at NOK 59 million, financed by loans and municipal grants, plus a NOK 10 million investment from Dansk Folkeferie. The airport was owned by Valdres Lufthavn A\/S, a privately held limited company with six municipalities as its principal shareholders. Following the airport's establishment, the Norwegian State Railways' Valdres Line was closed in 1989.\n\nBy 1988, building costs had increased from NOK 88 to 131 million. The municipalities had co-signed for a foreign loan, and were forced to pay NOK 3.5 million annually just in interest, in addition to the operating cost of the airport; these were aggravated by not only the loss of the sole scheduled service, but also considerably less charter traffic than estimated. In 1990, the airport company was forced to refinance, and NOK 61 of 85 million in dept was refinanced, and the obligations transferred from the airport company to the municipalities and the county. However, by 1991, passenger numbers were above 20,000, three quarters coming from charter traffic. On 1 January 1996, Fagernes Airport was nationalized, along with 25 other regional airports, and put under the control of the Norwegian Airport Authority (now Avinor). Following the closure of Geilo Airport, Dagali in 2003, Fagernes experienced an increase in charter traffic.\n\n","prompt":"When did Fagernes Airport, Leirin open?","answer":"31 October 1987.","generation":"Fagernes Airport, Leirin opened on 31 October 1987.","run_id":"task_1_run_17","is_correct":true,"is_hallucinated":false}

The 49th Pursuit Group was soon on its way to fight the Japanese in the South West Pacific. Arriving in Australia in February 1942, the 49th Pursuit Group moved to the Darwin area in March and April 1942. By this time, Darwin had been bombed several times. The 49th Pursuit Group became its principal defense. Conditions in the area were still primitive, and spare parts and equipment were scarce. Lacking adequate logistical support, the Americans were heavily dependent on their Australian allies. Morale in Darwin was low, but the sight of Wurtsmith's aircraft patrolling the skies provided an important boost. Between December 1941 and March 1942, over 300 P-40 Kittyhawks, 100 P-400 and 90 P-39 Airacobras had been sent to Australia; of these, around 125 had been lost to enemy action in the Dutch East Indies campaign, 75 had been transferred to the RAAF, 74 were under or awaiting repair and perhaps another 100 had yet to be completely assembled.

On 10 November, he scored all of Cardiff's goals in a 4–2 victory over West Bromwich Albion. He went on to finish the campaign as the club's top goalscorer having scored 23 times in the league, a career high tally. However, his campaign was overshadowed by a missed penalty on the final day of the season. In their last game, Cardiff met Birmingham. If they won the game Cardiff would be guaranteed the First Division title. The match was goalless after 70 minutes, when a goal-bound shot from Gill was blocked by the hand of a Birmingham defender resulting in a penalty being given. The club's usual penalty taker Jack Evans had missed recent attempts, while Gill was reluctant to take it. Davies instead stepped in to take the first penalty of his senior career. His teammate Fred Keenor later described the attempt, noting \"There is no doubt that the excitement and the knowledge that so much depended on the shot unnerved Len a little. Under ordinary circumstances it would have been a gift goal, but Len Davies muffed the kick and the ball rolled gently to the goalkeeper, who calmly gathered and made an easy clearance.\" The game eventually ended goalless while their nearest rivals Huddersfield Town won 3–0 and secured the title courtesy of goal average.

By mid-March 1998, its release date had been pushed back to fall; it soon slipped to winter. However, most of Meretzky's redesign ultimately was not used in the game. As the team prepared a software build for the 1998 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), the \"Strike Team\" overseeing Warcraft Adventures convened to assess the project. By this time, the game was in direct competition with the visually superior The Curse of Monkey Island, and LucasArts had begun to show off its upcoming 3D adventure Grim Fandango. As a result, Warcraft Adventures appeared technologically dated. In addition, the team estimated that implementing Meretzky's plan would require another half-year of work. Roper believed that improving the game to Blizzard's expected level of quality meant \"starting over\", and that a delay into 1999 was possible. In 2001, Blizzard's Mike Morhaime placed internal estimates at 9–12 months of added development time before Warcraft Adventures would have been brought to standard. As a result of the review, the \"Strike Team\" opted to end development of Warcraft Adventures, which Roper called the \"best [option] for our brand and the WarCraft license.\" The cancellation meeting contained around five senior members. According to Roper, the choice was difficult but was reached collectively, and came as a relief to a team that had been \"desperately trying to will this [game] into being\". Because the decision arrived just before Warcraft Adventures' scheduled appearance at E3, the game's designated booth space was replaced with kiosks for StarCraft. On May 22, 1998, Warcraft Adventures was publicly cancelled, after roughly 18 months of development. At the time, GameSpot's Ron Dulin and Curt Feldman called this event \"the beginning of a trend\" at the developer, citing its 1996 cancellation of Pax Imperia 2 for failing to meet internal quality standards. In retrospect, Roper considered Blizzard's conservative design plan for Warcraft Adventures to be its greatest mistake, and called it \"the only thing I would have changed\". He felt that the company's lack of forward thinking on the project left it outpaced by more ambitious games like Grim Fandango. Following the game's cancellation, he told GameSpot, > \"I think that one of the big problems with Warcraft Adventures was that we were actually creating a traditional adventure game, and what people expected from an adventure game, and very honestly what we expected from an adventure game, changed over the course of the project. And when we got to the point where we cancelled it, it was just because we looked at where we were and said, you know, this would have been great three years ago.\" ## Reception\n\n","prompt":"What was Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans competing with when it appeared technologically dated?","answer":"The Curse of Monkey Island and Grim Fandango.","generation":"Warcraft Adventures: Lord of the Clans was a graphic adventure game developed by Blizzard Entertainment in the mid-1990s. When its development was ongoing, particularly around 1997, it was supposed to compete with other popular adventure games of the time. However, due to technological advancements and the evolution of graphics in games, it started to appear dated compared to its contemporaries.\n\nBy the late 1990s, the gaming industry was seeing significant advancements in 3D graphics. Games like \"Grim Fandango\" (1998) by LucasArts and entries in the \"King's Quest\" series were pushing the boundaries of what adventure games could look like with more advanced graphics and 3D environments. Additionally, games like \"The Curse of Monkey Island\" (1997) showcased high-quality 2D animation that set a new standard for what players expected from graphic adventures.\n\nWarcraft Adventures relied on traditional 2D animation and a point-and-click interface, which began to feel outdated when more immersive and graphically advanced 3D games were entering the market. This technological mismatch, along with the high expectations associated with Blizzard's successful Warcraft franchise, contributed to the decision to cancel the game before its release.","run_id":"task_1_run_17","is_correct":false,"is_hallucinated":true}

After the match, Owen interrupted his brothers’ victory celebration to verbally attack Bret. The brothers reunited over the Christmas holidays and focused on challenging The Quebecers for the World Tag Team Championship at Royal Rumble 1994. During the match, Bret kayfabe injured his knee, which eventually caused the referee to stop the match. Owen then turned on Bret by kicking his injured leg and leaving him lying in the ring. Bret jobbed to Owen in the opening match at WrestleMania X but defeated Yokozuna later in the pay-per-view to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Jim Neidhart, Bret and Owen's real-life brother-in-law, became involved at King of the Ring 1994 by aligning himself with Owen Hart. To settle the feud, Bret and Owen were booked to face each other in a Steel cage match at SummerSlam. After losing a Casket match to Yokozuna at the 1994 Royal Rumble, The Undertaker did not appear in the WWF for several months. In reality, he was given time off to allow a back injury to heal. The WWF foreshadowed his return by airing videos of people who claimed to have seen The Undertaker. Eventually, DiBiase, who introduced The Undertaker to the WWF in 1990, claimed to have brought The Undertaker back to the WWF. but Paul Bearer informed him that DiBiase's Undertaker was an impostor and that Bearer had located the true Undertaker. This led to a match at SummerSlam pitting the two Undertakers against each other. In the buildup to the match, Leslie Nielsen performed short segments trying to solve the mystery of how two Undertakers could exist in a spinoff of his roles on Police Squad! and The Naked Gun films. ## Event\n\nIn a dark match before the pay-per-view broadcast, Adam Bomb pinned Kwang. As the broadcast opened, the commentators, Vince McMahon (fresh off his federal trial acquittal, one month earlier) and Jerry Lawler, announced that The Headshrinkers had dropped the tag team title to Diesel and Shawn Michaels, and that the belts would not be on the line at SummerSlam. Throughout the broadcast, Nielsen and his co-star from The Naked Gun, George Kennedy, appeared backstage in skits trying to solve the mystery of the two Undertakers.\n\n","prompt":"Who did Lex Luger agree to face at SummerSlam 1994 to settle the argument about joining Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Corporation?","answer":"Tatanka","generation":"At SummerSlam 1994, Lex Luger faced Tatanka to settle the argument about joining Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Corporation.

While performing an Iron Maiden cover, the band was spotted by Brian Slagel, a former music journalist who had recently founded Metal Blade Records. Slagel met with the band backstage and asked if they would like to be featured on the label's upcoming Metal Massacre III compilation; the band agreed. The band's appearance on the compilation created underground buzz, which led to Slagel signing the band with Metal Blade Records. Recorded in Los Angeles, California, Show No Mercy was financed by vocalist Tom Araya, who used his earnings as a respiratory therapist, and money borrowed from guitarist Kerry King's father. King says the album is \"fuckin' Iron Maiden here and there\". Vocalist Araya asserts Venom, Judas Priest, Iron Maiden, and Mercyful Fate were big influences on the record, as guitarist King was into the Satanic image. Lombardo said in 2015 that he was not pleased with how the drums were recorded. The engineer at the time had difficulties getting the right mix between the toms and the cymbals because they were too loud. The solution was to dampen the cymbals with towels and record the toms and cymbals separately. As such, Lombardo called Show No Mercy his least favorite Slayer album, although he emphasized that the songs were great, just not his performance.

Guarding the far side of the crossing were 3,500 soldiers, including 500 men-at-arms and an unknown number of mercenary crossbowmen under Godemar du Fay, an experienced French general. A contemporary chronicler described this as an elite unit. The ford was 2,000 yards (1,800 m) wide and as it was only 10 miles (16 km) from the coast, it was strongly tidal, only passable for a few hours twice each day. When the English arrived at dawn, the tide was high and not expected to drop to crossable levels for several hours. The French force was drawn up in three lines along the sloping north bank, with the best soldiers, the 500 men-at-arms, positioned in the centre. At about 9 a.m., a force of English longbowmen, led by Hugh, Baron Despenser, started across the ford, 12 abreast on the narrow causeway. They came under crossbow shot, but continued until the water was shallow enough for them to be able to reply. The numbers shooting from each side at this stage are not known, but the longbowmen had the advantages that those to the rear were able to send arrows over the heads of those in front of them, and that they could shoot three times faster than the crossbowmen. The English archery proved more effective than the French crossbow shot. As their crossbowmen were overcome, some French men-at-arms mounted and entered the river in an attempt to ride down the longbowmen. The English had their own force of mounted men-at-arms standing in the river behind their longbowmen, probably led by William, Earl of Northampton, and seeing the French mounting, they made their way through and around the ranks of archers and engaged the French on the water's edge in a disorderly mêlée. The opposing cavalry, having moved into contact at walking pace, suffered few casualties. The greater pressure of the English forced the mêlée onto the French bank of the river. The dismounted French men-at-arms were pushed back by the mass of retreating French and advancing English men-at-arms, making space for the English longbowmen to gain the riverbank.","prompt":"Who led the force of English longbowmen across the ford during the Battle of Blanchetaque?","answer":"Hugh, Baron Despenser","generation":"During the Battle of Blanchetaque, which took place on August 24, 1346, during the Hundred Years' War, the force of English longbowmen was led by Sir Thomas Holland.

Her mother, who died when Schuur was 13, loved jazz and had a Duke Ellington record collection. Her father, a police captain, was an amateur musician who often played piano with his daughter sitting by his side. Schuur stated, \"As far back as I can remember, singing was in my blood. My parents loved music, and I loved to sing. I was scatting at an early age\". She has absolute pitch memory. Unlike the average person, in Schuur's mind every sound – musical or not – has a note value; for example, if she hears a humming motor, she knows the name that note has on a musical instrument. Schuur listened to the radio avidly in her youth; her early musical idols were Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington. She said that as a small child she would often retreat to a closet to sing. Schuur first learned to play the piano by ear. Though she later learned to read braille-written music, she found its use frustrating and impractical since it took away use of one of her hands while playing the piano; however, she frequently used braille-transcribed lyrics in performances and during recording sessions. One of her first public performances was at age ten, singing country music at Tacoma's Holiday Inn; a booking arranged by her aunt. Even when she was a student at the Washington School for the Blind, she would come home on weekends, perform on Friday and Saturday nights and take a train back to school for Monday classes. At age 15 she was taken by her father to Lake Tahoe to audition as a lounge singer at Harrah's hotel and casino. She got the job, but her widowed father found it impossible to leave his job at the police force to chaperone her, and the offer had to be declined. Schuur was noticed by country music singer\/actor Jimmy Wakely, who met her in an Elks Club in 1971 when she was eighteen. After auditioning for him, Wakely arranged a recording session in California. Accompanied by her sister, Schuur took her first airplane trip to the session in Burbank, and made a 45 rpm record of a song called \"Dear Mommy and Daddy\". Schuur performed locally a great deal in her late teens, and had started to develop a distinctive musical voice.

Suffragists in Illinois pursued partial suffrage because full suffrage required a public referendum which activists believed they were likely to lose. Illinois had frequently passed such legislation through one house of the legislature before it ultimately stalled. McCormick adapted techniques she learned from her father to devise a campaign to pressure every member of the legislature. Trout, McCormick, and their associates met with every legislator and were present at the state capital every day of the 1913 legislative session until the measure passed both houses. Governor Edward F. Dunne signed the equal suffrage bill into law on June 26, 1913, gifting McCormick with one of the pens used in the signature. With the enactment of the law, over one million women gained the right to vote, doubling the number of women voters nationwide. McCormick remained an active worker for national suffrage until the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified. In 1913, she became chairman of the Congressional Committee for the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). She took over leadership from Alice Paul, who went on to form the Congressional Union as a separate national suffrage organization. The new position had McCormick relocate from Illinois to Washington, D.C., where she promptly found a new headquarters for the Committee. From that headquarters, she was tasked with getting more pro-suffrage candidates elected to state level offices. During her time as leader of the Congressional Committee, McCormick and Lewis J. Selznick of the World Film Corporation produced the melodrama Your Girl and Mine, which was intended to help gain support for the suffrage movement. The film never circulated broadly, despite critical praise from contemporary film reviewers, because the distribution agreement between NAWSA and the World Film Corporation fell apart shortly after the premiere in 1914 and the film was confined to private screenings. That same year, McCormick showed solidarity with black activists. McCormick marched alongside Irene McCoy Gaines in a Washington, D.C. suffrage parade, one year after NAWSA had insisted black women march separately. As chair of the campaign committee, McCormick donated a gold elephant to be melted down and sold to help finance suffrage efforts in several states. The elephant had been a gift from members of the Republican National Committee (RNC) to thank McCormick for traveling the country as part of the McKinley campaign.","prompt":"What position did Ruth Hanna McCormick assume in 1913 for the National American Woman Suffrage Association?","answer":"Chairman of the Congressional Committee","generation":"In 1913, Ruth Hanna McCormick became the head of the Congressional Committee of the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA).

The Klan was using murder and intimidation to prevent recently-freed slaves and members of the Republican Party from exercising their right to vote in the aftermath of the American Civil War. Following an increase in Klan activity in North Carolina—including the murder of a black town commissioner in Alamance County and the murder of a Republican state senator in Caswell County—Republican Governor of North Carolina William W. Holden declared both areas to be in a state of insurrection. In accordance with the Shoffner Act, Holden ordered a militia be raised to restore order in the counties and arrest Klansmen suspected of violence. This resulted in the creation of the 1st and 2nd North Carolina Troops, which Holden placed under the overall command of Colonel George Washington Kirk. In July 1870, Kirk oversaw the deployment of the 2nd North Carolina Troops in Alamance and Caswell counties, while the 1st North Carolina Troops garrisoned the city of Raleigh. A total of 82 men in Alamance and 19 in Caswell were detained on suspicion of Klan-related activity, including a former member of the United States Congress and the sheriffs of both counties, and Klan activity in both counties promptly ceased. No one was killed during the campaign, though the militiamen at times showed poor discipline and used foul language. Kirk's second-in-command also exceeded his orders and sent men to arrest a newspaper editor in Orange County, which was not declared to be in insurrection. Holden initially refused to have the men brought to regular courts under writs of habeas corpus, planning to try them by military tribunal, but eventually gave way to pressure from Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court Richmond Mumford Pearson and United States District Court Judge George Washington Brooks. As a result, 49 men were indicted in court for crimes, but all were ultimately acquitted and released by late August. The militiamen were also deployed to guard polling stations during North Carolina's legislative elections on August 4, but Holden's use of the militia as well as other complaints about Republican corruption and Klan intimidation led the Conservatives and Democrats to take a majority of seats in the North Carolina General Assembly. Holden ordered the militia to disband on September 21, and on November 10 he declared that there was no longer a state of insurrection in Alamance and Caswell counties. Conservative and Democratic-leaning newspapers heavily criticized his actions and his political opponents coined the name \"Kirk–Holden war\" to describe the affair. The General Assembly subsequently filed articles of impeachment against Holden in December and ultimately removed him from office in March 1871. Holden was the first governor in the United States to be removed in such fashion, and his campaign against the Klan and the impeachment crippled the image of the Republican Party in North Carolina for many years.

The Sibilla sought to stop and inspect the ship suspected of containing irregular migrants. The vessel instead ended up colliding with the ship and sinking it. According to Italian authorities, there was no intention to cause the collision. The Zefiro first approached and identified the Kateri i Radës as a motorboat with approximately 30 civilians on board. The motorboat continued toward Italy even though a stop order was issued by the Zefiro. This happened around 4:30 PM, near the Albanian island Sazan. Sibilia then took over the operation and during its maneuvers, the Italian ship caused the Kateri i Radës to turn which resulted in subsequent deaths. After the Albanian ship was capsized, the Sibilia allegedly left and came back approximately 20 minutes later. The bodies of at least 52 who lost their lives were recovered. The total number of dead may be as high as 83. The survivors were taken to the Apulian port of Brindisi, where they arrived at 2:45 AM.

In some species, there might also be changes in social behaviors, such as increased competitiveness or aggression, particularly in polygynous species where females compete for access to high-quality mates.

The position and supporting staff, of the Chief of Staff of the French Army was created with responsibility for training and mobilisation in peace and the formation of the army high command in times of war. The establishment of GQG in 1911 formalised this situation, with GQG becoming the wartime counterpart of the Conseil supérieur de la Guerre (CSG) and the vice-president of CSG becoming the chief of staff of the GQG. The GQG received extensive military powers within an area defined as the zone of army control; control of the remainder of the armed forces was retained by the Minister of War. GQG was activated upon the mobilisation of the French Army by Parliament, who also defined the zone of army control. The chief of staff was assisted by an état-major-général, who ran the GQG general staff of around 50 officers and saw that the commander-in-chief's orders were carried out and two aides-majors with responsibilities for the individual departments of GQG. GQG was originally organised into four bureaux (or departments). The First Bureau was responsible for organization, personnel and equipment; the Second Bureau for intelligence, information and political affairs; the Third Bureau for the planning of military operations and the Fourth Bureau (sometimes called the Direction de l'Arrière - Directorate of the Rear [lines]) for transport, communication and supply. The Third Bureau was considered by far the most powerful as it had control of active military operations. Its staff consisted mainly of liaison officers, embedded with individual unit headquarters. Though these officers were junior in rank to the generals commanding the armies, they held significant power over their careers through the reports made on their operations to GQG. One officer from the Third Bureau liaised with the French government and another with the president and they were said to wield \"considerable political power\". The Fourth Bureau had a wide remit, with responsibility for the management of military railways, motor vehicles, water transport, financial offices, post offices and telegraphy and its chief was sometimes called the directeur de l'arrière (director of the rear [lines]).

Destructoid's Zack Furniss felt that the primary accomplishment of Resident Evil 7 concerned its pacing, which was praised as \"masterful\". Furniss' apprehensive expectations of how the story would unfold were subverted to his liking, deeming the result a blend similar to the horror and comedy found in The Evil Dead films. He found a sense of finality in the combat and lauded it for having produced lasting tension. What held more sway, however, was the priority of survival horror, with the management of limited resources meeting a positive response. Furniss considered the boss fights to be \"harrowing\" and welcomed the consistent surreality of the game. His playthrough with the PlayStation VR inspired unease, unpredictable jump scares and ultimately an \"intuitive\" experience. Ray Carsillo of EGMNow favored the atmosphere's constant mood of anxiety, which was partly impacted by the interiors of the main setting. The sound design was also thought to complement this sense of dread, increasing the level of player involvement. He noted the slow narrative build as the game's most substantial achievement, and likened its efficacy to that of earlier games in the series. Like Furniss, Carsillo expressed appreciation for the pacing, and opined that it brought considerable intrigue, accommodating lengthy play sessions. Playing with the virtual reality headset was \"even more frightening than doing it normally\", according to Carsillo, echoing Furniss' view that it made the game more immersive. Writing for Game Informer, Andrew Reiner commended the \"tense, unsettling, overly gory\" atmosphere for providing a competent introduction to Resident Evil 7. The Baker house and the nature of exploring it posed significant interest to him, for together, they would present new aspects regarding the occupants and be enhanced by the first-person perspective. Scott Butterworth at GameSpot enjoyed the narrative overall, valuing its memorable moments and the thematic consistency of the writing. He was impressed with the reliance of atmosphere as opposed to jump scares to heighten the feeling of danger. Using the Baker family to multifarious ends of gameplay was complimented as a logical extension of the established world; the interactive VHS tapes were approved of for the same reason, said to serve \"beautifully as both a narrative device and a way to break up Ethan's exhausting mission\".","prompt":"What aspect of Resident Evil 7 did critics particularly praise for its execution, considering it contributed to the game's overall sense of tension and anxiety?","answer":"The atmosphere's constant mood of anxiety and the pacing.","generation":"Critics particularly praised Resident Evil 7 for its effective use of the first-person perspective, which contributed significantly to the game's overall sense of tension and anxiety.

Her keel was laid on 15 May 1920, and she was launched on 23 May 1921. She was sponsored by Mrs. Charles E. Tudor, wife of the Director of Safety of Cincinnati, having been designated by the Honorable John Galvin, Mayor of Cincinnati. Cincinnati was commissioned on 1 January 1924, Captain Charles P. Nelson in command. Cincinnati was 550 feet (170 m) long at the waterline with an overall length of 555 feet 6 inches (169.32 m), her beam was 55 ft 4 in (16.87 m) and had a mean draft of 13 ft 6 in (4.11 m). Her standard displacement was 7,050 long tons (7,163 t) and 9,507 long tons (9,660 t) at full load. Her crew, during peacetime, consisted of 29 officers and 429 enlisted men. Cincinnati was powered by four Westinghouse geared steam turbines, each driving one screw, using steam generated by 12 Yarrow boilers. The engines were designed to produce 90,000 shaft horsepower (67,000 kW) and reach a top speed of 35 knots (65 km\/h; 40 mph). She was designed to provide a range of 10,000 nautical miles (19,000 km; 12,000 mi) at a speed of 10 kn (19 km\/h; 12 mph), but was only capable of 8,460 nmi (15,670 km; 9,740 mi) at a speed of 10 knots. Cincinnati's main armament went through many changes while she was being designed. Originally she was to mount ten 6-inch (150 mm)\/53 caliber guns; two on either side at the waist, with the remaining eight mounted in tiered casemates on either side of the fore and aft superstructures. After the United States entry into World War I the US Navy worked alongside the Royal Navy and it was decided to mount four 6-inch\/53 caliber guns in two twin gun turrets fore and aft and keep the eight guns in the tiered casemates so that she would have an eight gun broadside and, due to limited arcs of fire from the casemate guns, four to six guns firing fore or aft.","prompt":"Who was the sponsor of USS Cincinnati (CL-6) during its launching?","answer":"Mrs. Charles E.

Jaffit had been the lead designer at the Brisbane office of Pandemic Studios, while Treble, after leaving Pandemic Studios, had worked for Krome Studios. By the late 2000s, operating such studios had become comparatively expensive in the country, given a historically high value of the Australian dollar and tax breaks for video game studios in other countries. Pandemic Studios, previously acquired by Electronic Arts, was shut down in 2009, and Krome Studios closed in 2010, as did several other developers around the same time. These closures coincided with a rise of indie and mobile game development in Australia, which Jaffit saw as an opportunity for a new studio. He joined with Treble and they established Defiant on 21 May 2010.\n\nThe studio's first game was Rocket Bunnies, a mobile game released later in 2010. Throughout 2011, the company developed three augmented reality games: The first, Inch High Stunt Guy, was created for Qualcomm's \"Augmented Reality Developer Challenge\", finishing second and winning . The company also created Floodlines and Hoops AR (previously known as Bankshot). In April 2012, Defiant published Ski Safari, an \"endless skier\" game developed by Brendan Watts and Shawn Eustace. The company then released Heroes Call (previously called Quick Quest), a free-to-play dungeon crawl game for iOS, in May that year. According to Jaffit, Defiant self-published its games to avoid becoming dependent on a publisher for funds, with the added pressure of repaying the publisher's investment after a game's release. However, for the release of Heroes Call, the studio invested its entire budget into polishing the game, forcing the studio to shift to work-for-hire jobs shortly thereafter.\n\n","prompt":"What was the first mobile game released by Defiant Development in 2010?","answer":"Rocket Bunnies","generation":"The first mobile game released by Defiant Development in 2010 was \"Rocket Bunnies.\"","run_id":"task_1_run_19","is_correct":true,"is_hallucinated":false}

Several operations failed to restore her knee to a state where she could play professional basketball, although she is still able to walk. This ended Schünemann's basketball career for a time. She moved to Tübingen, where she studied sports management with a focus on sports marketing at the University of Tübingen. In 2012, she worked full-time as a marketing consultant for an energy company. Schünemann did some coaching and played for the regional league, but her knee still bothered her and national league offers were cancelled. Andreas Joneck, who later became the manager of RSV Lahn-Dill persuaded Schünemann to try wheelchair basketball. She began playing for the seconds on her 18th birthday. RSV Lahn-Dill went on to win the national championship in 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, with Schünemann playing forward. In 2013, Schünemann moved to Hamburg, where her boyfriend Christian lives, and now plays forward-center for BG Baskets Hamburg, a mixed gender team. In April 2014, she was part of the BG Baskets Hamburg team that won the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation Euro League Challenge Cup, its first International title.

Construction started in 1985, but plans were changed in 1986, when local authorities decided to build a longer runway to allow charter flights. The nearby Geilo Airport, Dagali, a two-hour drive away, had already made a similar decision, and was in the process of extending its own runway. The airport opened on 31 October 1987. The state had initially paid 60% of the NOK 29.3 million investments for the 800-metre (2,600 ft) version of the airport, and the rest was financed by municipal and county grants. The increased cost of building a longer runway was estimated at NOK 59 million, financed by loans and municipal grants, plus a NOK 10 million investment from Dansk Folkeferie. The airport was owned by Valdres Lufthavn A\/S, a privately held limited company with six municipalities as its principal shareholders. Following the airport's establishment, the Norwegian State Railways' Valdres Line was closed in 1989.\n\nBy 1988, building costs had increased from NOK 88 to 131 million. The municipalities had co-signed for a foreign loan, and were forced to pay NOK 3.5 million annually just in interest, in addition to the operating cost of the airport; these were aggravated by not only the loss of the sole scheduled service, but also considerably less charter traffic than estimated. In 1990, the airport company was forced to refinance, and NOK 61 of 85 million in dept was refinanced, and the obligations transferred from the airport company to the municipalities and the county. However, by 1991, passenger numbers were above 20,000, three quarters coming from charter traffic. On 1 January 1996, Fagernes Airport was nationalized, along with 25 other regional airports, and put under the control of the Norwegian Airport Authority (now Avinor).

From 15 September to 27 October, he embarked on a scoring run, netting in six of the seven matches his side played, which included winning goals in two matches. On 10 November, he scored all of Cardiff's goals in a 4–2 victory over West Bromwich Albion. He went on to finish the campaign as the club's top goalscorer having scored 23 times in the league, a career high tally. However, his campaign was overshadowed by a missed penalty on the final day of the season. In their last game, Cardiff met Birmingham. If they won the game Cardiff would be guaranteed the First Division title. The match was goalless after 70 minutes, when a goal-bound shot from Gill was blocked by the hand of a Birmingham defender resulting in a penalty being given. The club's usual penalty taker Jack Evans had missed recent attempts, while Gill was reluctant to take it. Davies instead stepped in to take the first penalty of his senior career. His teammate Fred Keenor later described the attempt, noting \"There is no doubt that the excitement and the knowledge that so much depended on the shot unnerved Len a little. Under ordinary circumstances it would have been a gift goal, but Len Davies muffed the kick and the ball rolled gently to the goalkeeper, who calmly gathered and made an easy clearance.\" The game eventually ended goalless while their nearest rivals Huddersfield Town won 3–0 and secured the title courtesy of goal average. The difference between the two sides, 0.024 of a goal remains the closest margin of victory ever recorded in the top tier of English football. Davies was said to be inconsolable following the miss. He was again Cardiff's highest goalscorer the following year, netting 20 times despite suffering several injury problems that restricted him to 30 league appearances.

By mid-March 1998, its release date had been pushed back to fall; it soon slipped to winter. However, most of Meretzky's redesign ultimately was not used in the game. As the team prepared a software build for the 1998 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), the \"Strike Team\" overseeing Warcraft Adventures convened to assess the project. By this time, the game was in direct competition with the visually superior The Curse of Monkey Island, and LucasArts had begun to show off its upcoming 3D adventure Grim Fandango. As a result, Warcraft Adventures appeared technologically dated. In addition, the team estimated that implementing Meretzky's plan would require another half-year of work. Roper believed that improving the game to Blizzard's expected level of quality meant \"starting over\", and that a delay into 1999 was possible. In 2001, Blizzard's Mike Morhaime placed internal estimates at 9–12 months of added development time before Warcraft Adventures would have been brought to standard. As a result of the review, the \"Strike Team\" opted to end development of Warcraft Adventures, which Roper called the \"best [option] for our brand and the WarCraft license.\" The cancellation meeting contained around five senior members. According to Roper, the choice was difficult but was reached collectively, and came as a relief to a team that had been \"desperately trying to will this [game] into being\". Because the decision arrived just before Warcraft Adventures' scheduled appearance at E3, the game's designated booth space was replaced with kiosks for StarCraft. On May 22, 1998, Warcraft Adventures was publicly cancelled, after roughly 18 months of development. At the time, GameSpot's Ron Dulin and Curt Feldman called this event \"the beginning of a trend\" at the developer, citing its 1996 cancellation of Pax Imperia 2 for failing to meet internal quality standards. In retrospect, Roper considered Blizzard's conservative design plan for Warcraft Adventures to be its greatest mistake, and called it \"the only thing I would have changed\". He felt that the company's lack of forward thinking on the project left it outpaced by more ambitious games like Grim Fandango. Following the game's cancellation, he told GameSpot, > \"I think that one of the big problems with Warcraft Adventures was that we were actually creating a traditional adventure game, and what people expected from an adventure game, and very honestly what we expected from an adventure game, changed over the course of the project.

This led to a kayfabe admission from Luger that he had met with DiBiase, but Luger repeatedly denied having joined the corporation. He agreed to face Tatanka at SummerSlam to settle the argument. Jeff Jarrett and Mabel had no real feud going into SummerSlam. Jarrett played the role of an aspiring country music singer, and Mabel portrayed a rapper. As a result, the WWF promoted the match as part of a \"rap versus country\" rivalry. There was little buildup for the match until Mabel was booked to confront Jarrett on Monday Night Raw the week before SummerSlam. He tried to provoke Jarrett into a fight, but Jarrett walked away through the crowd to avoid Mabel. The biggest storyline at SummerSlam began at the 1993 Survivor Series when Owen Hart was eliminated from the “Hart Brothers vs. Shawn Michaels and His Knights” elimination match due to miscommunication within the Hart team. Bret Hart was walking along the ring apron when Owen ran into him, causing Owen to lose his focus and be pinned by Michaels. After the match, Owen interrupted his brothers’ victory celebration to verbally attack Bret. The brothers reunited over the Christmas holidays and focused on challenging The Quebecers for the World Tag Team Championship at Royal Rumble 1994. During the match, Bret kayfabe injured his knee, which eventually caused the referee to stop the match. Owen then turned on Bret by kicking his injured leg and leaving him lying in the ring. Bret jobbed to Owen in the opening match at WrestleMania X but defeated Yokozuna later in the pay-per-view to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Jim Neidhart, Bret and Owen's real-life brother-in-law, became involved at King of the Ring 1994 by aligning himself with Owen Hart. To settle the feud, Bret and Owen were booked to face each other in a Steel cage match at SummerSlam. After losing a Casket match to Yokozuna at the 1994 Royal Rumble, The Undertaker did not appear in the WWF for several months. In reality, he was given time off to allow a back injury to heal. The WWF foreshadowed his return by airing videos of people who claimed to have seen The Undertaker. Eventually, DiBiase, who introduced The Undertaker to the WWF in 1990, claimed to have brought The Undertaker back to the WWF. but Paul Bearer informed him that DiBiase's Undertaker was an impostor and that Bearer had located the true Undertaker. This led to a match at SummerSlam pitting the two Undertakers against each other.

The band's appearance on the compilation created underground buzz, which led to Slagel signing the band with Metal Blade Records. Recorded in Los Angeles, California, Show No Mercy was financed by vocalist Tom Araya, who used his earnings as a respiratory therapist, and money borrowed from guitarist Kerry King's father.

Guarding the far side of the crossing were 3,500 soldiers, including 500 men-at-arms and an unknown number of mercenary crossbowmen under Godemar du Fay, an experienced French general. A contemporary chronicler described this as an elite unit. The ford was 2,000 yards (1,800 m) wide and as it was only 10 miles (16 km) from the coast, it was strongly tidal, only passable for a few hours twice each day. When the English arrived at dawn, the tide was high and not expected to drop to crossable levels for several hours. The French force was drawn up in three lines along the sloping north bank, with the best soldiers, the 500 men-at-arms, positioned in the centre. At about 9 a.m., a force of English longbowmen, led by Hugh, Baron Despenser, started across the ford, 12 abreast on the narrow causeway. They came under crossbow shot, but continued until the water was shallow enough for them to be able to reply. The numbers shooting from each side at this stage are not known, but the longbowmen had the advantages that those to the rear were able to send arrows over the heads of those in front of them, and that they could shoot three times faster than the crossbowmen. The English archery proved more effective than the French crossbow shot. As their crossbowmen were overcome, some French men-at-arms mounted and entered the river in an attempt to ride down the longbowmen. The English had their own force of mounted men-at-arms standing in the river behind their longbowmen, probably led by William, Earl of Northampton, and seeing the French mounting, they made their way through and around the ranks of archers and engaged the French on the water's edge in a disorderly mêlée. The opposing cavalry, having moved into contact at walking pace, suffered few casualties. The greater pressure of the English forced the mêlée onto the French bank of the river. The dismounted French men-at-arms were pushed back by the mass of retreating French and advancing English men-at-arms, making space for the English longbowmen to gain the riverbank.","prompt":"Who led the force of English longbowmen across the ford during the Battle of Blanchetaque?","answer":"Hugh, Baron Despenser","generation":"During the Battle of Blanchetaque, which took place on August 24, 1346, during the Hundred Years' War, the English forces were led by King Edward III.

My parents loved music, and I loved to sing. I was scatting at an early age\". She has absolute pitch memory. Unlike the average person, in Schuur's mind every sound – musical or not – has a note value; for example, if she hears a humming motor, she knows the name that note has on a musical instrument. Schuur listened to the radio avidly in her youth; her early musical idols were Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington. She said that as a small child she would often retreat to a closet to sing. Schuur first learned to play the piano by ear. Though she later learned to read braille-written music, she found its use frustrating and impractical since it took away use of one of her hands while playing the piano; however, she frequently used braille-transcribed lyrics in performances and during recording sessions. One of her first public performances was at age ten, singing country music at Tacoma's Holiday Inn; a booking arranged by her aunt. Even when she was a student at the Washington School for the Blind, she would come home on weekends, perform on Friday and Saturday nights and take a train back to school for Monday classes. At age 15 she was taken by her father to Lake Tahoe to audition as a lounge singer at Harrah's hotel and casino. She got the job, but her widowed father found it impossible to leave his job at the police force to chaperone her, and the offer had to be declined.

Suffragists in Illinois pursued partial suffrage because full suffrage required a public referendum which activists believed they were likely to lose. Illinois had frequently passed such legislation through one house of the legislature before it ultimately stalled. McCormick adapted techniques she learned from her father to devise a campaign to pressure every member of the legislature. Trout, McCormick, and their associates met with every legislator and were present at the state capital every day of the 1913 legislative session until the measure passed both houses. Governor Edward F. Dunne signed the equal suffrage bill into law on June 26, 1913, gifting McCormick with one of the pens used in the signature. With the enactment of the law, over one million women gained the right to vote, doubling the number of women voters nationwide. McCormick remained an active worker for national suffrage until the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified. In 1913, she became chairman of the Congressional Committee for the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). She took over leadership from Alice Paul, who went on to form the Congressional Union as a separate national suffrage organization. The new position had McCormick relocate from Illinois to Washington, D.C., where she promptly found a new headquarters for the Committee. From that headquarters, she was tasked with getting more pro-suffrage candidates elected to state level offices. During her time as leader of the Congressional Committee, McCormick and Lewis J. Selznick of the World Film Corporation produced the melodrama Your Girl and Mine, which was intended to help gain support for the suffrage movement. The film never circulated broadly, despite critical praise from contemporary film reviewers, because the distribution agreement between NAWSA and the World Film Corporation fell apart shortly after the premiere in 1914 and the film was confined to private screenings. That same year, McCormick showed solidarity with black activists. McCormick marched alongside Irene McCoy Gaines in a Washington, D.C. suffrage parade, one year after NAWSA had insisted black women march separately. As chair of the campaign committee, McCormick donated a gold elephant to be melted down and sold to help finance suffrage efforts in several states. The elephant had been a gift from members of the Republican National Committee (RNC) to thank McCormick for traveling the country as part of the McKinley campaign.","prompt":"What position did Ruth Hanna McCormick assume in 1913 for the National American Woman Suffrage Association?","answer":"Chairman of the Congressional Committee","generation":"In 1913, Ruth Hanna McCormick assumed the position of head of the Congressional Committee for the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA).

The Klan was using murder and intimidation to prevent recently-freed slaves and members of the Republican Party from exercising their right to vote in the aftermath of the American Civil War. Following an increase in Klan activity in North Carolina—including the murder of a black town commissioner in Alamance County and the murder of a Republican state senator in Caswell County—Republican Governor of North Carolina William W. Holden declared both areas to be in a state of insurrection. In accordance with the Shoffner Act, Holden ordered a militia be raised to restore order in the counties and arrest Klansmen suspected of violence. This resulted in the creation of the 1st and 2nd North Carolina Troops, which Holden placed under the overall command of Colonel George Washington Kirk. In July 1870, Kirk oversaw the deployment of the 2nd North Carolina Troops in Alamance and Caswell counties, while the 1st North Carolina Troops garrisoned the city of Raleigh. A total of 82 men in Alamance and 19 in Caswell were detained on suspicion of Klan-related activity, including a former member of the United States Congress and the sheriffs of both counties, and Klan activity in both counties promptly ceased. No one was killed during the campaign, though the militiamen at times showed poor discipline and used foul language. Kirk's second-in-command also exceeded his orders and sent men to arrest a newspaper editor in Orange County, which was not declared to be in insurrection. Holden initially refused to have the men brought to regular courts under writs of habeas corpus, planning to try them by military tribunal, but eventually gave way to pressure from Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court Richmond Mumford Pearson and United States District Court Judge George Washington Brooks. As a result, 49 men were indicted in court for crimes, but all were ultimately acquitted and released by late August. The militiamen were also deployed to guard polling stations during North Carolina's legislative elections on August 4, but Holden's use of the militia as well as other complaints about Republican corruption and Klan intimidation led the Conservatives and Democrats to take a majority of seats in the North Carolina General Assembly. Holden ordered the militia to disband on September 21, and on November 10 he declared that there was no longer a state of insurrection in Alamance and Caswell counties. Conservative and Democratic-leaning newspapers heavily criticized his actions and his political opponents coined the name \"Kirk–Holden war\" to describe the affair. The General Assembly subsequently filed articles of impeachment against Holden in December and ultimately removed him from office in March 1871. Holden was the first governor in the United States to be removed in such fashion, and his campaign against the Klan and the impeachment crippled the image of the Republican Party in North Carolina for many years. The General Assembly subsequently repealed the Shoffner Act and passed another law designed to grant amnesty to Klansmen. ## Background\n\n","prompt":"What was the name of the Republican Governor of North Carolina who declared areas in a state of insurrection during the Kirk–Holden war?","answer":"William W.

The two ships—Andrea Doria and Duilio—were completed during World War I. The class was an incremental improvement over the preceding Conte di Cavour class. Like the earlier ships, Andrea Doria and Duilio were armed with a main battery of thirteen 305-millimeter (12.0 in) guns.\n\nThe two ships were based in southern Italy during World War I to help ensure that the Austro-Hungarian Navy's surface fleet would be contained in the Adriatic. Neither vessel saw any combat during the conflict. After the war, they cruised the Mediterranean and were involved in several international incidents, including at Corfu in 1923. In 1933, both ships were placed in reserve. In 1937 the ships began a lengthy reconstruction. The modifications included removing their center main battery turret and boring out the rest of the guns to 320 mm (12.6 in), strengthening their armor protection, installing new boilers and steam turbines, and lengthening their hulls. The reconstruction work lasted until 1940, by which time Italy was already engaged in World War II.\n\nThe two ships were moored in Taranto on the night of 11\/12 November 1940 when the British launched a carrier strike on the Italian fleet. In the resulting Battle of Taranto, Duilio was hit by a torpedo and forced to beach to avoid sinking. Andrea Doria was undamaged in the raid; repairs for Duilio lasted until May 1941. Both ships escorted convoys to North Africa in late 1941, including Operation M42, where Andrea Doria saw action at the inconclusive First Battle of Sirte on 17 December. Fuel shortages curtailed further activities in 1942 and 1943, and both ships were interned at Malta following Italy's surrender in September 1943. Italy was permitted to retain both battleships after the war, and they alternated as fleet flagship until the early 1950s, when they were removed from active service. Both ships were scrapped after 1956.\n\n ## Design and description\n\nThe Andrea Doria-class ships were designed by naval architect Vice Admiral (Generale del Genio navale) Giuseppe Valsecchi and were ordered in response to French plans to build the Bretagne-class battleships. The design of the preceding Conte di Cavour-class battleships was generally satisfactory and was adopted with some minor changes. These mostly concerned the reduction of the superstructure by shortening the forecastle deck, the consequent lowering of the amidships gun turret and the upgrading of the secondary armament to sixteen 152-millimeter (6 in) guns in lieu of the eighteen 120-millimeter (4.7 in) guns of the older ships.\n\n ### General characteristics\n\nThe ships of the Andrea Doria class were 168.9 meters (554 ft 2 in) long at the waterline, and 176 meters (577 ft 5 in) overall. They had a beam of 28 meters (91 ft 10 in), and a draft of 9.4 meters (30 ft 10 in). They displaced 22,956 long tons (23,324 t) at normal load, and 24,729 long tons (25,126 t) at deep load. They were provided with a complete double bottom and their hulls were subdivided by 23 longitudinal and transverse bulkheads. The ships had two rudders, both on the centerline. They had a crew of 31 officers and 969 enlisted men.\n\n","prompt":"What was the beam measurement of the Andrea Doria-class battleships?","answer":"28 meters (91 ft 10 in)","generation":"The Andrea Doria-class battleships, originally built for the Italian Royal Navy during World War I, had a beam of 28.03 meters (about 92 feet).

It was freed around five minutes later when one of the keepers pressed a hot iron bar against her teeth, causing the tigress to recoil and release Maccomo's hand, which had been lacerated. Such spectacles were expected by the audience; one man gave 10 shillings to Maccomo in recognition of his bravery. In 1862, Maccomo performed in Norwich where his show consisted of him pursuing lions and tigers with a whip and firearm. During the show, a young lion bit Maccamo's hand and dragged him across the floor. As a result, part of the bone of his index finger had to be removed. Maccomo was attacked again by a Bengal tiger whilst performing in Dalkeith in 1866. A contemporary news story reported that his injuries \"were merely of a superficial nature\". In February 1866, Maccomo was awarded a gold medal by Manders during a presentation at Joseph Battley's Lodge-Lane Hotel in Liverpool. The inscription on the medal read \"Martini Maccomo, 1866.

Goodman used the book, published by Vanguard Press, to grapple with the religious implications of psychoanalysis and transition from a career writing on Jewish concerns to a period that would culminate in his collaboration on the founding work of the gestalt therapy movement.\n\nMany reviewers and commentators felt that Goodman overanalyzed Kafka and overextended specific symbolism, with farfetched or reductive speculation and obscure personal referents. Goodman's monograph was the first on Kafka in the English language and holds an idiosyncratic place in Kafka studies.\n\n","prompt":"What is the title of the 1947 book by Paul Goodman that analyzes Franz Kafka and his works?","answer":"Kafka's Prayer","generation":"The title of the 1947 book by Paul Goodman that analyzes Franz Kafka and his works is \"Kafka's Prayer\".","run_id":"task_1_run_2","is_correct":true,"is_hallucinated":false}

The browser version currently holds five game modes: FFA (Free-For-All), Battle Royale, Teams, Experimental, and Party. The mobile version of the game includes Classic (like FFA), Rush Mode, and Battle Royale. The goal of the game is to obtain the largest cell; players must restart from a small cell when all their cells are eaten by larger players or fountain viruses. Players can change their cell's appearance with predefined words, phrases, symbols, or skins. The more mass a cell has, the more slowly it will move. Cells will gradually lose a small amount of mass over time.\n\nViruses are green, spiky circles that split cells that consume them into many smaller cells, rendering them vulnerable and attractive targets to other players. Players can hide under viruses if their cell is small enough and their name short enough. Viruses are normally randomly generated, but players can also cause viruses to split in two by \"feeding\" them mass—typically in the direction of another nearby cell which the player wants to consume.\n\nPlayers can split their cell into two, and one of the two evenly divided cells (if the mass of the original cell is odd, one cell will be slightly bigger than the other) will be shot in the direction of the cursor when the space bar was pressed. This can be used as a ranged attack to shoot a cell in order to swallow other smaller cells or to escape an attack and move quickly around the map. Split cells merge back into one cell if a bigger cell of the same player consumes it. Aside from feeding viruses, players can release a small fraction of their mass to feed other cells, an action commonly recognized as an intention to team with another player.\n\n ## History\n\n ### Development\n\nAgar.io was created by nineteen-year-old Brazilian developer Matheus Valadares, written in JavaScript and C++. Valadares shared an IP address to the game for playtesting on the 4chan video game board \/v\/ and game development forums, before releasing it on the domain agar.io on 28 April 2015. It is named after agar, a substance used to grow cell cultures. Valadares continued to experiment with adding new featuresexperimental mode was created specifically for this purpose. He thought about adding more complex biological features like photosynthesis and mitochondria, but ultimately decided to strip the game down to its current simple mechanics.

His sentences slide from silk to steel, and take tonal joy rides from the ironic to the earnest. But he never gets lost in the language, as he sometimes has in the past. Structurally, this may be his most confident novel. The secondary characters and their subplots are more fully developed, right down to their personal e-mail styles.

Tyrannosaurid remains have never been recovered from eastern North America, while more basal tyrannosauroids, like Dryptosaurus and Appalachiosaurus, persisted there until the end of the Cretaceous, indicating that tyrannosaurids must have evolved in or dispersed into western North America after the continent was divided in half by the Western Interior Seaway in the middle of the Cretaceous. Tyrannosaurid fossils have been found in Alaska, which may have provided a route for dispersal between North America and Asia. Alioramus and Tarbosaurus are found to be related in one cladistic analysis, forming a unique Asian branch of the family. This was later disproven with the discovery of Qianzhousaurus and the description of the tyrannosaur family Alioramini.

Tudor, wife of the Director of Safety of Cincinnati, having been designated by the Honorable John Galvin, Mayor of Cincinnati. Cincinnati was commissioned on 1 January 1924, Captain Charles P. Nelson in command. Cincinnati was 550 feet (170 m) long at the waterline with an overall length of 555 feet 6 inches (169.32 m), her beam was 55 ft 4 in (16.87 m) and had a mean draft of 13 ft 6 in (4.11 m).

Cincinnati was powered by four Westinghouse geared steam turbines, each driving one screw, using steam generated by 12 Yarrow boilers. The engines were designed to produce 90,000 shaft horsepower (67,000 kW) and reach a top speed of 35 knots (65 km\/h; 40 mph).

Jaffit had been the lead designer at the Brisbane office of Pandemic Studios, while Treble, after leaving Pandemic Studios, had worked for Krome Studios. By the late 2000s, operating such studios had become comparatively expensive in the country, given a historically high value of the Australian dollar and tax breaks for video game studios in other countries. Pandemic Studios, previously acquired by Electronic Arts, was shut down in 2009, and Krome Studios closed in 2010, as did several other developers around the same time. These closures coincided with a rise of indie and mobile game development in Australia, which Jaffit saw as an opportunity for a new studio. He joined with Treble and they established Defiant on 21 May 2010.\n\nThe studio's first game was Rocket Bunnies, a mobile game released later in 2010. Throughout 2011, the company developed three augmented reality games: The first, Inch High Stunt Guy, was created for Qualcomm's \"Augmented Reality Developer Challenge\", finishing second and winning . The company also created Floodlines and Hoops AR (previously known as Bankshot). In April 2012, Defiant published Ski Safari, an \"endless skier\" game developed by Brendan Watts and Shawn Eustace. The company then released Heroes Call (previously called Quick Quest), a free-to-play dungeon crawl game for iOS, in May that year. According to Jaffit, Defiant self-published its games to avoid becoming dependent on a publisher for funds, with the added pressure of repaying the publisher's investment after a game's release.

Several operations failed to restore her knee to a state where she could play professional basketball, although she is still able to walk. This ended Schünemann's basketball career for a time. She moved to Tübingen, where she studied sports management with a focus on sports marketing at the University of Tübingen. In 2012, she worked full-time as a marketing consultant for an energy company. Schünemann did some coaching and played for the regional league, but her knee still bothered her and national league offers were cancelled. Andreas Joneck, who later became the manager of RSV Lahn-Dill persuaded Schünemann to try wheelchair basketball. She began playing for the seconds on her 18th birthday. RSV Lahn-Dill went on to win the national championship in 2008, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, with Schünemann playing forward.

The nearby Geilo Airport, Dagali, a two-hour drive away, had already made a similar decision, and was in the process of extending its own runway. The airport opened on 31 October 1987. The state had initially paid 60% of the NOK 29.3 million investments for the 800-metre (2,600 ft) version of the airport, and the rest was financed by municipal and county grants. The increased cost of building a longer runway was estimated at NOK 59 million, financed by loans and municipal grants, plus a NOK 10 million investment from Dansk Folkeferie. The airport was owned by Valdres Lufthavn A\/S, a privately held limited company with six municipalities as its principal shareholders. Following the airport's establishment, the Norwegian State Railways' Valdres Line was closed in 1989.\n\nBy 1988, building costs had increased from NOK 88 to 131 million. The municipalities had co-signed for a foreign loan, and were forced to pay NOK 3.5 million annually just in interest, in addition to the operating cost of the airport; these were aggravated by not only the loss of the sole scheduled service, but also considerably less charter traffic than estimated. In 1990, the airport company was forced to refinance, and NOK 61 of 85 million in dept was refinanced, and the obligations transferred from the airport company to the municipalities and the county. However, by 1991, passenger numbers were above 20,000, three quarters coming from charter traffic. On 1 January 1996, Fagernes Airport was nationalized, along with 25 other regional airports, and put under the control of the Norwegian Airport Authority (now Avinor).

From 15 September to 27 October, he embarked on a scoring run, netting in six of the seven matches his side played, which included winning goals in two matches. On 10 November, he scored all of Cardiff's goals in a 4–2 victory over West Bromwich Albion. He went on to finish the campaign as the club's top goalscorer having scored 23 times in the league, a career high tally. However, his campaign was overshadowed by a missed penalty on the final day of the season. In their last game, Cardiff met Birmingham. If they won the game Cardiff would be guaranteed the First Division title. The match was goalless after 70 minutes, when a goal-bound shot from Gill was blocked by the hand of a Birmingham defender resulting in a penalty being given. The club's usual penalty taker Jack Evans had missed recent attempts, while Gill was reluctant to take it. Davies instead stepped in to take the first penalty of his senior career. His teammate Fred Keenor later described the attempt, noting \"There is no doubt that the excitement and the knowledge that so much depended on the shot unnerved Len a little. Under ordinary circumstances it would have been a gift goal, but Len Davies muffed the kick and the ball rolled gently to the goalkeeper, who calmly gathered and made an easy clearance.\" The game eventually ended goalless while their nearest rivals Huddersfield Town won 3–0 and secured the title courtesy of goal average. The difference between the two sides, 0.024 of a goal remains the closest margin of victory ever recorded in the top tier of English football. Davies was said to be inconsolable following the miss. He was again Cardiff's highest goalscorer the following year, netting 20 times despite suffering several injury problems that restricted him to 30 league appearances. However, his injury issues cost him a place in the squad for 1925 FA Cup final with Joe Nicholson starting in his place. His side went on to suffer defeat against Sheffield United.

By mid-March 1998, its release date had been pushed back to fall; it soon slipped to winter. However, most of Meretzky's redesign ultimately was not used in the game. As the team prepared a software build for the 1998 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3), the \"Strike Team\" overseeing Warcraft Adventures convened to assess the project. By this time, the game was in direct competition with the visually superior The Curse of Monkey Island, and LucasArts had begun to show off its upcoming 3D adventure Grim Fandango. As a result, Warcraft Adventures appeared technologically dated. In addition, the team estimated that implementing Meretzky's plan would require another half-year of work. Roper believed that improving the game to Blizzard's expected level of quality meant \"starting over\", and that a delay into 1999 was possible. In 2001, Blizzard's Mike Morhaime placed internal estimates at 9–12 months of added development time before Warcraft Adventures would have been brought to standard. As a result of the review, the \"Strike Team\" opted to end development of Warcraft Adventures, which Roper called the \"best [option] for our brand and the WarCraft license.\" The cancellation meeting contained around five senior members. According to Roper, the choice was difficult but was reached collectively, and came as a relief to a team that had been \"desperately trying to will this [game] into being\". Because the decision arrived just before Warcraft Adventures' scheduled appearance at E3, the game's designated booth space was replaced with kiosks for StarCraft. On May 22, 1998, Warcraft Adventures was publicly cancelled, after roughly 18 months of development. At the time, GameSpot's Ron Dulin and Curt Feldman called this event \"the beginning of a trend\" at the developer, citing its 1996 cancellation of Pax Imperia 2 for failing to meet internal quality standards. In retrospect, Roper considered Blizzard's conservative design plan for Warcraft Adventures to be its greatest mistake, and called it \"the only thing I would have changed\". He felt that the company's lack of forward thinking on the project left it outpaced by more ambitious games like Grim Fandango. Following the game's cancellation, he told GameSpot, > \"I think that one of the big problems with Warcraft Adventures was that we were actually creating a traditional adventure game, and what people expected from an adventure game, and very honestly what we expected from an adventure game, changed over the course of the project.

By the time it was nearing completion in 1998, the game appeared technologically dated because it was competing with more advanced titles in the adventure genre and beyond. At the time, the gaming industry was transitioning towards 3D graphics, and many other games were utilizing more modern technology and design. Notable competitors that highlighted this technological disparity included games like \"Grim Fandango\" (1998), which combined 3D computer graphics with traditional adventure gameplay, as well as other 3D-centered games like \"Tomb Raider\" (1996) and \"Quake\" (1996), which were shaping player expectations in terms of graphics and gameplay immersion. These advancements made the 2D, hand-drawn style of \"Warcraft Adventures\" feel obsolete and contributed to Blizzard's decision to cancel the game.","run_id":"task_1_run_20","is_correct":false,"is_hallucinated":true}

This led to a kayfabe admission from Luger that he had met with DiBiase, but Luger repeatedly denied having joined the corporation. He agreed to face Tatanka at SummerSlam to settle the argument. Jeff Jarrett and Mabel had no real feud going into SummerSlam. Jarrett played the role of an aspiring country music singer, and Mabel portrayed a rapper. As a result, the WWF promoted the match as part of a \"rap versus country\" rivalry. There was little buildup for the match until Mabel was booked to confront Jarrett on Monday Night Raw the week before SummerSlam. He tried to provoke Jarrett into a fight, but Jarrett walked away through the crowd to avoid Mabel. The biggest storyline at SummerSlam began at the 1993 Survivor Series when Owen Hart was eliminated from the “Hart Brothers vs. Shawn Michaels and His Knights” elimination match due to miscommunication within the Hart team. Bret Hart was walking along the ring apron when Owen ran into him, causing Owen to lose his focus and be pinned by Michaels. After the match, Owen interrupted his brothers’ victory celebration to verbally attack Bret. The brothers reunited over the Christmas holidays and focused on challenging The Quebecers for the World Tag Team Championship at Royal Rumble 1994. During the match, Bret kayfabe injured his knee, which eventually caused the referee to stop the match. Owen then turned on Bret by kicking his injured leg and leaving him lying in the ring. Bret jobbed to Owen in the opening match at WrestleMania X but defeated Yokozuna later in the pay-per-view to win the WWF World Heavyweight Championship. Jim Neidhart, Bret and Owen's real-life brother-in-law, became involved at King of the Ring 1994 by aligning himself with Owen Hart. To settle the feud, Bret and Owen were booked to face each other in a Steel cage match at SummerSlam. After losing a Casket match to Yokozuna at the 1994 Royal Rumble, The Undertaker did not appear in the WWF for several months. In reality, he was given time off to allow a back injury to heal.

Eventually, DiBiase, who introduced The Undertaker to the WWF in 1990, claimed to have brought The Undertaker back to the WWF. but Paul Bearer informed him that DiBiase's Undertaker was an impostor and that Bearer had located the true Undertaker.

The band's appearance on the compilation created underground buzz, which led to Slagel signing the band with Metal Blade Records.

Guarding the far side of the crossing were 3,500 soldiers, including 500 men-at-arms and an unknown number of mercenary crossbowmen under Godemar du Fay, an experienced French general. A contemporary chronicler described this as an elite unit. The ford was 2,000 yards (1,800 m) wide and as it was only 10 miles (16 km) from the coast, it was strongly tidal, only passable for a few hours twice each day. When the English arrived at dawn, the tide was high and not expected to drop to crossable levels for several hours. The French force was drawn up in three lines along the sloping north bank, with the best soldiers, the 500 men-at-arms, positioned in the centre. At about 9 a.m., a force of English longbowmen, led by Hugh, Baron Despenser, started across the ford, 12 abreast on the narrow causeway. They came under crossbow shot, but continued until the water was shallow enough for them to be able to reply. The numbers shooting from each side at this stage are not known, but the longbowmen had the advantages that those to the rear were able to send arrows over the heads of those in front of them, and that they could shoot three times faster than the crossbowmen. The English archery proved more effective than the French crossbow shot. As their crossbowmen were overcome, some French men-at-arms mounted and entered the river in an attempt to ride down the longbowmen. The English had their own force of mounted men-at-arms standing in the river behind their longbowmen, probably led by William, Earl of Northampton, and seeing the French mounting, they made their way through and around the ranks of archers and engaged the French on the water's edge in a disorderly mêlée. The opposing cavalry, having moved into contact at walking pace, suffered few casualties. The greater pressure of the English forced the mêlée onto the French bank of the river. The dismounted French men-at-arms were pushed back by the mass of retreating French and advancing English men-at-arms, making space for the English longbowmen to gain the riverbank.","prompt":"Who led the force of English longbowmen across the ford during the Battle of Blanchetaque?","answer":"Hugh, Baron Despenser","generation":"During the Battle of Blanchetaque on August 24, 1346, during the Hundred Years' War, the English forces were led by King Edward III.

My parents loved music, and I loved to sing. I was scatting at an early age\". She has absolute pitch memory. Unlike the average person, in Schuur's mind every sound – musical or not – has a note value; for example, if she hears a humming motor, she knows the name that note has on a musical instrument. Schuur listened to the radio avidly in her youth; her early musical idols were Sarah Vaughan and Dinah Washington. She said that as a small child she would often retreat to a closet to sing. Schuur first learned to play the piano by ear. Though she later learned to read braille-written music, she found its use frustrating and impractical since it took away use of one of her hands while playing the piano; however, she frequently used braille-transcribed lyrics in performances and during recording sessions. One of her first public performances was at age ten, singing country music at Tacoma's Holiday Inn; a booking arranged by her aunt. Even when she was a student at the Washington School for the Blind, she would come home on weekends, perform on Friday and Saturday nights and take a train back to school for Monday classes.

Suffragists in Illinois pursued partial suffrage because full suffrage required a public referendum which activists believed they were likely to lose. Illinois had frequently passed such legislation through one house of the legislature before it ultimately stalled. McCormick adapted techniques she learned from her father to devise a campaign to pressure every member of the legislature. Trout, McCormick, and their associates met with every legislator and were present at the state capital every day of the 1913 legislative session until the measure passed both houses. Governor Edward F. Dunne signed the equal suffrage bill into law on June 26, 1913, gifting McCormick with one of the pens used in the signature. With the enactment of the law, over one million women gained the right to vote, doubling the number of women voters nationwide. McCormick remained an active worker for national suffrage until the Nineteenth Amendment was ratified. In 1913, she became chairman of the Congressional Committee for the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). She took over leadership from Alice Paul, who went on to form the Congressional Union as a separate national suffrage organization. The new position had McCormick relocate from Illinois to Washington, D.C., where she promptly found a new headquarters for the Committee. From that headquarters, she was tasked with getting more pro-suffrage candidates elected to state level offices. During her time as leader of the Congressional Committee, McCormick and Lewis J. Selznick of the World Film Corporation produced the melodrama Your Girl and Mine, which was intended to help gain support for the suffrage movement. The film never circulated broadly, despite critical praise from contemporary film reviewers, because the distribution agreement between NAWSA and the World Film Corporation fell apart shortly after the premiere in 1914 and the film was confined to private screenings. That same year, McCormick showed solidarity with black activists.

The Klan was using murder and intimidation to prevent recently-freed slaves and members of the Republican Party from exercising their right to vote in the aftermath of the American Civil War. Following an increase in Klan activity in North Carolina—including the murder of a black town commissioner in Alamance County and the murder of a Republican state senator in Caswell County—Republican Governor of North Carolina William W. Holden declared both areas to be in a state of insurrection. In accordance with the Shoffner Act, Holden ordered a militia be raised to restore order in the counties and arrest Klansmen suspected of violence. This resulted in the creation of the 1st and 2nd North Carolina Troops, which Holden placed under the overall command of Colonel George Washington Kirk. In July 1870, Kirk oversaw the deployment of the 2nd North Carolina Troops in Alamance and Caswell counties, while the 1st North Carolina Troops garrisoned the city of Raleigh. A total of 82 men in Alamance and 19 in Caswell were detained on suspicion of Klan-related activity, including a former member of the United States Congress and the sheriffs of both counties, and Klan activity in both counties promptly ceased. No one was killed during the campaign, though the militiamen at times showed poor discipline and used foul language. Kirk's second-in-command also exceeded his orders and sent men to arrest a newspaper editor in Orange County, which was not declared to be in insurrection. Holden initially refused to have the men brought to regular courts under writs of habeas corpus, planning to try them by military tribunal, but eventually gave way to pressure from Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court Richmond Mumford Pearson and United States District Court Judge George Washington Brooks. As a result, 49 men were indicted in court for crimes, but all were ultimately acquitted and released by late August. The militiamen were also deployed to guard polling stations during North Carolina's legislative elections on August 4, but Holden's use of the militia as well as other complaints about Republican corruption and Klan intimidation led the Conservatives and Democrats to take a majority of seats in the North Carolina General Assembly. Holden ordered the militia to disband on September 21, and on November 10 he declared that there was no longer a state of insurrection in Alamance and Caswell counties. Conservative and Democratic-leaning newspapers heavily criticized his actions and his political opponents coined the name \"Kirk–Holden war\" to describe the affair. The General Assembly subsequently filed articles of impeachment against Holden in December and ultimately removed him from office in March 1871. Holden was the first governor in the United States to be removed in such fashion, and his campaign against the Klan and the impeachment crippled the image of the Republican Party in North Carolina for many years. The General Assembly subsequently repealed the Shoffner Act and passed another law designed to grant amnesty to Klansmen. ## Background\n\n","prompt":"What was the name of the Republican Governor of North Carolina who declared areas in a state of insurrection during the Kirk–Holden war?","answer":"William W.

Over the following months, several minor media releases were made, revealing new information regarding the game's developmental direction and graphical style. The game's release was highly anticipated by journalists in the video game industry, who published various previews and interviews with the development team, particularly with lead designer Michael Stemmle, one of the original designers of Sam & Max Hit the Road. In August 2003, LucasArts halted production on the Full Throttle adventure game sequel Hell on Wheels, leading the magazine Hyper to speculate that Freelance Police might suffer a similar fate.

After his first account of jewellery in Algeria and Tunisia L'orfévrerie algérienne et tunisienne (1902), he published a thematic dictionary with an even wider geographical scope, titled Dictionnaire des bijoux de l’Afrique du Nord. Maroc, Algérie, Tunisie, Tripolitaine (1906). Based on his travels to these countries, he compiled detailed information about Berber and other styles of jewellery with graphic illustrations for his notes. Jean Besancenot (1902-1992), a French painter, self-trained ethnographer and documentary photographer, produced detailed descriptions as well as numerous photographs and artistic illustrations of traditional costumes and other forms of personal adornment in Morocco. Commissioned by the administration of the French protectorate, he had collected these ethnographic records during his extensive travels in the country between 1934 and 1939. For his illustrated book Costumes du Maroc (1942), he identified three basic categories of costumes: rural Berber dress, Jewish dress and urban citizens' costumes, some of which with Arab elements of dress. Further, each of the portraits of his 60 gouache paintings was attributed to a specific social role (married woman, palace guard, musician etc.), city or region, and Berber dress also assigned to corresponding tribal groups. As these forms of dress were still very much alive and differentiated in the 1930s, Besancenot remarked that in rural areas, each type of dress represented a tribal identity. As his artistic colour portraits of persons in full length did not allow sufficient space for elements like hair styles, shoes or how to drape loose pieces of textiles, such as the urban haik and Berber draped garments, he added explanations and drawings of these pieces of personal appearance. In order to represent jewellery in detail, he added descriptions and drawings of 56 pieces of urban as well as of 38 rural Berber styles. In his second work, Bijoux arabes et berbères du Maroc (1953), he published his drawings and descriptions of almost 200 pieces of jewellery from different places and traditions in Morocco. Besancenot originally was a painter, and his drawings highlight the intricate features of the pieces in reduced detail compared to his corresponding photographs. In the course of his field visits, he had learned to use photography as a means of quickly capturing his ethnographic impressions. In an interview with the journalist Dominique Carré, he commented on his approach: \"I wanted to prove that scientists very often pursue their investigations in a frame of mind that partially leaves aside the aesthetic aspect. [...] They thoroughly study a number of things, but often neglect the aspects of traditional arts that contain a very important aesthetic value. I wanted to restore this value.\"","prompt":"Who was the French painter and ethnographer who documented Moroccan traditional costumes and jewellery, compiling almost 200 pieces in his work \"Bijoux arabes et berbères du Maroc\"?","answer":"Jean Besancenot","generation":"The French painter and ethnographer who documented Moroccan traditional costumes and jewelry is Pierre Bergé.

There were six depressions tracked by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), which is the official Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the northern Indian Ocean. The agency also tracked four cyclonic storms, which have maximum winds of at least 65 km\/h (40 mph) sustained over 3 minutes. The American-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) tracked an additional storm – Tropical Storm Vamei – which crossed over from the South China Sea at a record-low latitude.\n\nThe first storm originated on May 21, and became the strongest recorded storm in the Arabian Sea at the time. The IMD estimated peak 3 minute winds of 215 km\/h (135 mph) while the storm was off the west coast of India. The storm weakened greatly before making landfall in Gujarat, and although impact on land was minor, it left up to 950 fishermen missing. A few weeks later, the first Bay of Bengal system originated – a short-lived depression that dropped heavy rainfall upon striking Odisha. After a period of inactivity during the monsoon season, there were cyclonic storms in September and October in the northern Arabian Sea. Both lasted only a few days and dissipated due to unfavorable wind shear. Another cyclonic storm formed in the Bay of Bengal and struck Andhra Pradesh, which dropped heavy rainfall that was equivalent to 300% of the average October precipitation total. The rains caused flooding, particularly in Cuddapah, where a dam was deliberately opened and inundated the town overnight.

The objective of the game is either to arrive quickly at a level's finish line or to receive maximum points for trick combinations. In 1080°'s two trick modes, trick attack and contest, players accrue points from completed tricks. In contest mode, players perform tricks and snowboard past flags for points. Trick attack mode requires players to perform a series of tricks throughout a designated level. The game features 24 tricks and 5 secret tricks, all of which are performed by using a combination of circular positions of the control stick, the R button, the Z button and the B button; point values are allocated based on complexity, combos, and required time. The two types of tricks are grab tricks, in which the board is grabbed in a specific way, or spin tricks, in which the snowboarder spins the board a certain number of degrees. The 1080° spin requires nine actions, the most of any trick in the game. 1080° has three race modes; in these modes, victory can be achieved by taking separate routes within a course and balancing the snowboarder after a jump to avoid speed loss. Tricks are scored in race modes, but do not count toward victory. In match race mode, the player competes in a series of races against AI-controlled snowboarders. The game times the player throughout the level and players receive a damage meter which fills if the snowboarder falls down or is knocked over. The difficulty level in match races can be set to normal, hard, or expert, adjusting the complexity and number of races. If the player fails at defeating an AI competitor, they must retire. The player is given three chances to beat the computer before the game is over. Players may initially choose from five snowboarding characters: two from Japan, and one each from Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom. Each snowboarder has different abilities and is suited for different levels and modes, since each has varying statistics in fields such as technique, speed, and weight. Three additional snowboarders are unlocked by completing certain game levels and modes. Eight snowboards are initially available for every character, and one additional snowboard may be unlocked later in the game. Each board also excels in different situations, since each has different strengths in categories such as balance and edge control.","prompt":"What is the maximum number of actions required to perform the most complex trick in \"1080° Snowboarding\"?","answer":"Nine actions.","generation":"In the game \"1080° Snowboarding,\" the most complex trick you can perform is the 1080-degree spin. This move involves the snowboarder completing three full spins in the air. To successfully execute this trick, you need to initiate the spin with a specific combination of controls, which includes gaining enough speed, timing your jump correctly, and rotating your character using a series of inputs on the game controller.\n\nWhile executing the 1080 spin involves multiple actions, it's difficult to specify the exact number of distinct input actions required because it can vary based on how players initiate the jump, manage rotations, and adjust their movement in the air. Generally, several button presses and joystick movements are needed, but it is the combination and timing of these actions that make the trick complex rather than just a count of discrete actions.","run_id":"task_1_run_4","is_correct":false,"is_hallucinated":true}

This manual is written with the player as the reader. It does not explain what the fox player-character knows about the story or if they understand the constructed language. A fox awakens on a shore, and begins to journey through the game world, which is filled with ruins. After collecting a weapon and shield and ringing two magical bells, the fox enters a temple and then a spiritual plane known as the Far Shore. There they encounter the spirit of a larger fox trapped in a crystal prison, referred to in the manual as the Heir. The fox leaves to collect the three crystal keys to the prison which can be found within dungeons across the land. If the fox is killed, the Heir revives them. As the fox collects the crystal keys, they encounter glowing purple essence, which powers parts of the ruins, including the golden platforms, and is relayed by glowing black obelisks. While collecting the last key, the fox journeys through a mine—where purple essence seems to be taking over the world itself—into an underground factory where the souls of foxes are being forcibly confined into the obelisks. After collecting the Keys and freeing the Heir, the Heir attacks and kills the fox. The fox, now in spirit form, appears in a night-time version of the overworld, with many paths obstructed by the purple essence. Most enemies have disappeared and the land is instead populated by the souls of other foxes, which speak only in the game's constructed writing system. The fox visits the six Graves of the Hero, which each return parts of the fox's spirit and restore them to life. Collecting enough pages of the manual reveals that there had previously been a civilization of foxes, which looked for power from outside of reality. Seeking immortality, they found a way to entomb the souls of foxes from the past and future into obelisks as a source of power. A religion formed around the power and the Hero who found it, with the faithful exempt from their souls being used. This power was corrupted through overuse, causing the purple essence to begin to erode reality and loop time. One fox, the Heir, was trapped outside of the time loop, but acts as a beacon to draw in a replacement Heir, continuing the cycle. If the restored fox defeats the Heir, they become the new Heir, and the game ends. The player is then given the options to quit, to restart from the beginning in a New Game Plus mode with most of their items, or else to restart from just before the battle. A second ending occurs instead if the player, before fighting the Heir, follows the \"golden path\". This requires them to collect the pages of the manual and solve the puzzle at the top of the mountain that uses the pages. Afterwards, when the player confronts the Heir, instead of fighting they show them the manual, showing how to break the cycle and freeing them.","prompt":"What does the fox player character collect to help reveal the plot in Tunic?","answer":"manual pages","generation":"In the game \"Tunic,\" the fox player character collects pages of a mysterious in-game manual.

In interviews prior to the album's release, Cooder expressed strong anti-Republican and anti-banker sentiments in discussion about the political and economic climate. Before conceiving the album, he wrote and recorded the song \"Quicksand\" in 2010, as a response to the controversy spurred by Arizona Senate Bill 1070 and other anti-illegal immigration measures in the United States. In an interview for The Australian, Cooder said of his decision to pursue a more political direction with his songwriting: > I was still working on the Flathead record; that was during [George] Bush's time. I was looking at things and paying attention to events, politically. So I started trying to write political songs because it's good to have something you can do other than just sit and fume about everything. After Barack Obama got elected I started thinking about other stories that might be good to do. It occurred to me that the social and political problems that we've been having, well ... it's deja vu all over again, as the man said. In early 2011, Cooder was inspired to write the song \"No Banker Left Behind\", and subsequently the rest of the album, by a headline about bankers and other affluent people who had profited from the bank bailouts and resulting recession during the late-2000s. In an interview with Kai Ryssdal on Marketplace, Cooder cited the song as the starting point for writing the album and stated, \"'No Banker Left Behind' originated with a line from Robert Scheer's Truthdig blog. I read this pretty regularly, and when I saw this, this metric I thought 'no banker left behind.'\" He compared the album's content to Woody Guthrie's songs about the Dust Bowl era during the Great Depression and said of his own songs, \"What I like in the idea of these songs is if you follow the logic of each tune — this happened and this happened and you can see that at the end, this is the result, you just didn't see it this way before, you never thought of Wall Street in terms of Jesse James and bilingual heft.\" Recording sessions for Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down took place at Drive-By Studios in North Hollywood, Ocean Studios in Burbank, and Wireland Studios in Chatsworth, California. The album was written and produced entirely by Cooder, except \"Lord Tell Me Why\", which was co-written by session drummer Jim Keltner. Cooder also worked with vocalist Juliette Commagere, accordionist Flaco Jiménez, bassist Robert Francis, vocalist Arnold McCuller, and drummer Joachim Cooder, Cooder's son. Pull Up Some Dust and Sit Down was mixed by Martin Pradler and mastered by recording engineer Bernie Grundman at his Hollywood studio Grundman Mastering.

His family moved to Florida when he was a toddler. Clippard played baseball in Little League; in eleven years, he won seven district titles, but was never able to reach the Little League World Series. He learned to pitch when he was eight years old. In 2001, he was a member of the Palm Harbor team that won the Senior League World Series.\n\nClippard began his high school career at Palm Harbor University High School in Palm Harbor, Florida. After failing to make the varsity baseball team in his first two seasons, he transferred to J. W. Mitchell High School in New Port Richey, Florida, where he played for the school's baseball team. As a junior, in 2002, he won six games. He was named to the All-Conference first team.\n\nIn 2003, his senior season, Clippard had a 1–1 record with an 0.81 ERA and 31 strikeouts in 17+1⁄3 innings pitched. However, he was dismissed from the school's baseball team after being charged with driving under the influence of alcohol. Clippard transferred to Dunedin High School in Dunedin, Florida, which had a nationally ranked baseball team. Clippard attempted to play for their team, but the move was blocked by the Florida High School Athletic Association, as players are not allowed to transfer during the course of a season, nor are they allowed to transfer to avoid sanctions given for disciplinary reasons. After taking classes at Dunedin for a month, Clippard transferred back to Mitchell in order to graduate from high school with his friends.\n\nClippard competed for the Central Florida Renegades in Connie Mack Baseball, an amateur 18-and-under competition organized by the American Amateur Baseball Congress. He earned pitcher of the week honors in the Florida State Elite Baseball League in June 2003.\n\nClippard also played golf at Mitchell. As a sophomore, in 2001, Clippard was named one of the ten best golfers in Pasco County. He registered the best individual score in the Sunshine Athletic Conference tournament that year. He was named to the All-Conference first team as a junior and to the All-County as a senior, and helped lead Mitchell to victory in the Sunshine Athletic Conference tournament during his senior year.\n\n ## Professional career\n\n ### Draft\n\nWithout the benefit of a full senior season to show himself off to scouts, Clippard proactively sent scouts a schedule of when he was throwing and attended as many showcases as he could. He trained with Roy Silver, a retired professional baseball player, who worked with Clippard on his mechanics and his maturity. Clippard's father, Bob, teamed up with Tom Kotchman, father of Florida high school player Casey Kotchman, to form showcases with past teammates of Clippard.\n\nClippard was drafted in the ninth round of the 2003 MLB draft, with the 274th overall selection, by the New York Yankees. Though he had signed a National Letter of Intent in the fall of 2002 to attend the University of South Florida on a baseball scholarship, allowing him to play college baseball for the South Florida Bulls, he chose to turn professional due to his draft position and the opportunity to play for the Yankees.\n\n","prompt":"What was Tyler Clippard's ERA during his senior season in high school?","answer":"0.81 ERA","generation":"Tyler Clippard's ERA during his senior season in high school was 0.87.","run_id":"task_1_run_4","is_correct":false,"is_hallucinated":true}

There is some evidence that elements of the KPA 3rd Division guarded them after capture. During the first night of captivity, the KPA gave the American prisoners water, fruit and cigarettes. Survivors claimed this was the only food and water the KPA gave them over the three days of their imprisonment. The Americans dug holes in the sand to get more water to drink. The KPA intended to move them across the Nakdong River that night, but US artillery fire on the river crossing sites prevented safe movement. During the night, two of the Americans loosened their bindings, causing a brief commotion. KPA soldiers threatened to shoot the Americans but, according to one survivor's account, a KPA officer shot one of his own men for threatening this. Two captured American officers—Lieutenant Hudspeth, the platoon leader of the mortar platoon, and Lieutenant Cecil Newman, who was a forward artillery observer, were seen conferring with each other about an escape plan according to Private Fred Ryan. Both escaped during the night, but were captured and executed. The KPA attempted to keep the Americans hidden during the day and move them at night, but attacks by US forces made this difficult. The next day, August 16, the prisoners were moved with their guards. One of the mortarmen, Corporal Roy L. Day Jr., spoke Japanese and was able to converse with some of the North Koreans. That afternoon, he overheard a KPA lieutenant say they would kill the prisoners if US forces advanced too close. Later that day, other US forces began to assault Hill 303 to retake the position.

The high quality and elaborate nature of the church's decoration, particularly its mouldings and tracery, indicate how the machine of royal patronage lead to a move away from the deliberate austerity of the early Cistercian churches towards the grandeur then considered appropriate to a secular church such as a cathedral. Construction of the church proceeded from east to west. The sanctuary and transepts were built first to allow the monks to hold services, and the nave was completed over time. It is not known precisely when the building work began, but major gifts by King Henry of roofing timber and lead from Derbyshire in 1251 and 1252 indicate that some of the eastern parts of the church, and probably of the east cloister range too, had by then reached an advanced stage. The presence of a foundation stone at the base of the southeast pier of the crossing inscribed \"H.DI. GRA REX ANGE\" (Latin for Henry by the Grace of God King of the English) shows that the foundations of the centre of the church reached ground level after 1251, the year Henry III formally became the abbey's patron. Taking many decades to complete, the church was probably finished between 1290 and 1320. Dating the various parts of the building relies predominantly on stylistic criteria. The church was cruciform in shape, with vaulting and a square sanctuary and a low central tower containing bells. It was aisled throughout, with a pair of chapels on the east side of each transept. There was no triforium, but a narrow gallery surmounted by a clerestory of triple lancet windows ran above each bay of the arcade, as can be seen in the surviving section in the south transept. The vaulting sprang directly from the top of the arcade. The wall at the eastern end of the sanctuary, probably built after 1260, had a large window which features an upper rose and elaborate tracery; the aisle windows were simple paired lancets recessed within an arch. In the nave, the south aisle had plain triple lancets set high in the wall to avoid the cloister roof.","prompt":"In what architectural style was the large church at Netley Abbey built?","answer":"Gothic style","generation":"The large church at Netley Abbey was built in the Gothic architectural style.

As he had fought in the front rank, Edward claimed many of the prisoners as his own, including Charny, whose captor he rewarded with a gratuity of 100 marks (approximately £ in terms). That evening Edward, who was always conscious of the image he presented, invited the higher-ranking of the captives to dine with him, revealing that he had fought them incognito. He made pleasant conversation with all but Charny, whom he taunted with having abandoned his chivalric principles both by fighting during a truce and by attempting to purchase his way into Calais rather than fight. The detailed defences of Charny's actions later published suggest that the charges had merit by the standards of the time. Charny was considered a paragon of knightly honour, was acknowledged by contemporaries as a \"true and perfect Knight\", and was the author of several books on chivalry. He was also the keeper of the Oriflamme, the French royal battle banner; the requirements of this office included being \"a knight noble in intention and deed ... virtuous ... and chivalrous\". The accusations struck deep and were astute blows in the active propaganda war between the two countries. The modern historian Jonathan Sumption reports that the whole affair was so embarrassing that French participants were said to have \"maintained a tight-lipped silence\" regarding their roles in it. Whether Charny had acted in an unknightly manner in attempting to purchase his way into Calais was still being debated in the 19th century. Ribeaumont was promptly released on parole, so Philip should have a first-hand account of the débâcle. Ribeaumont later voluntarily travelled to England to surrender himself until his ransom was paid. Most of the prisoners were paroled on a promise not to fight until they had redeemed themselves. Charny had to wait eighteen months until his ransom was paid in full, for his release. The amount is not known, but King John II (r. 1350–1364), Philip's son and successor after his father's death during Charny's imprisonment, made a partial contribution of 12,000 écus (approximately £ in terms). During his captivity Charny wrote much of his famous Book of Chivalry (Livre de chevalerie), in which he warns against turning to \"cunning schemes\" as opposed to actions which are \"true, loyal and sensible\". Amerigo was allowed to keep the instalment of his bribe he had received from Renti. He soon returned to Italy and went on a pilgrimage to Rome. The fate of his hostaged son, who was carried off into French captivity in the nearby town of Guînes, is not known.","prompt":"What did King John II contribute towards Charny's ransom during his imprisonment?","answer":"12,000 écus","generation":"King John II of France made a notable contribution towards the ransom of Geoffroi de Charny, a prominent French knight captured during the early phases of the Hundred Years' War. After the Battle of Poitiers in 1356, where King John himself was captured, he made efforts to support fellow captives and uphold chivalric values. Although the specific amount or nature of his contribution to Charny's ransom isn't precisely detailed in historical records, it demonstrates the interconnectedness and mutual support among the French nobility during this tumultuous period. Additionally, the king's actions would have illustrated the high regard in which knights like Charny were held, as well as the importance of maintaining honor and loyalty within the ranks of nobility.","run_id":"task_1_run_4","is_correct":false,"is_hallucinated":true}

Among his titles was \"overseer of all of the construction works of the king\", meaning he oversaw all of the royal construction projects and in this role likely worked directly with Kha. One stick was a gift from Neferhebef, with a dedicatory inscription recording that it was made by him, presumably for Kha, but the space where Kha's name would be inserted was left blank. Another stick belonged to Khaemwaset, who likely worked alongside him as he also bears the title \"chief of the Great Place\". Kha's senet board had previously belonged to a man named Benermeret who was associated with the cult of Amun at Karnak temple, and who had it inscribed and decorated for his parents Neferhebef and Taiunes. Merit's personal possessions were much fewer than Kha's, and were placed beside her bed, near the door. Egyptologist Lynn Meskell considers this difference in the quantity of items to be a reflection of the inequality between the sexes at the elite level of ancient Egyptian society. A large wooden cabinet, 1.10 metres (3.6 ft) tall, contained her wig which \"still shines with the perfumed oils that were applied to it\". It is one of the best examples to have survived from ancient Egypt and represents the \"enveloping\" style of wig that was common during the Eighteenth and early Nineteenth Dynasties. It is made of locks of human hair styled into tight waves and ending in tiny ringlets. At the back, the wig forms three thick plaits. It would not have been thick enough to entirely cover Merit's own hair when worn and would have been an addition to her own styled hair. Investigation using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry indicated the presence of plant oils and \"balsam\". As no fixative is present on the wig, it is suggested it was styled by braiding when wet, and that the oils mentioned by Schiaparelli are a \"perfumed moisturizing treatment meant to keep the hair in good condition\". Two smaller baskets contained personal effects such as needles, a razor, bone hairpins, combs, spare braids of hair, a tool possibly used to curl hair or wigs, and dried raisins. A large sheet, stained with oil but carefully stored, was considered by Schiaparelli to be Merit's dressing gown. Merit's cosmetics were stored inside a box likely made especially for the funeral, with funerary inscriptions and painted in imitation of inlay. They consisted of a wooden comb and vessels of alabaster and faience holding ointments and oils; two objects were of multi-colored glass – a small jar for oils and a kohl tube.","prompt":"Who was associated with the cult of Amun at the Karnak temple and had a senet board inscribed and decorated for his parents?","answer":"Benermeret","generation":"The individual associated with the cult of Amun at the Karnak temple, who had a senet board inscribed and decorated for his parents, was Sennefer.

Ovens came in two types—a single-use construction of the kind used in the production of charcoal, and a more permanent type, basically consisting of two walls one meter and a half thick. Ovens could hold up to a million bricks. Masonry bricks were fired between 900 °C (1,650 °F) and 1,125 °C (2,057 °F), klinkers between 1,150 °C (2,100 °F) and 1,250 °C (2,280 °F). Typically, bricks were baked at low heat for two weeks to remove all remaining moisture from the clay, and then for four weeks at a higher temperature, followed by two weeks of cooling down. Since the klinker was partially vitrified by being fired at a higher temperature it was harder than the standard. Klinkers were imported into England for use as paving. Small, yellow Dutch bricks used to be imported into the United States, and as of 1840 there were still old buildings in New York faced in these bricks. They were considered superior in appearance and in durability.

On 9 May, part of her crew were sent to participate in a celebration marking the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Aspern. The rest of the year passed uneventfully, and her time as a station ship temporarily came to an end on 28 February 1910, when she was ordered to serve as the flotilla leader for the Torpedo-boat Flotilla, replacing Kaiser Karl VI, which had been sent on a cruise abroad. During this period, Aspern was present for the launch of the pre-dreadnought Zrinyi on 12 April in Trieste. She resumed her station ship duties on 6 May until 15 November, when she was decommissioned for a major overhaul of the ship's propulsion machinery and partial replacement of her boiler tubes. She also had an oven to bake fresh bread installed. Work lasted into 1911, and she remained out of service for the entire year. In early 1912, Aspern was assigned to the Reserve Squadron. She was present at the launching ceremony for the dreadnought battleship Tegetthoff on 20 March. Six days later, she participated in a naval review held in Fasana for the visit of German Kaiser Wilhelm II. Aspern was detached to join I Cruiser Division, which was sent to the Ottoman Empire, from 15 May to 15 August to protect Austro-Hungarian interests during a period of unrest in the country. Further unrest in Ottoman Syria prompted the Austro-Hungarian Navy to send a more powerful force—the battleships Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand, Radetzky, and Zrinyi, the cruisers Aspern and Admiral Spaun, and the destroyers Uskoke and Wildfang—to make a naval demonstration. The fleet left Pola on 5 November and stopped in Beşik Bay at the entrance to the Dardanelles on 7 November, where they waited for two days for authorization to enter the straits and proceed to the Ottoman capital at Constantinople. There, they stayed until 2 December; further riots did not develop, so the fleet was recalled, arriving in Pola on 6 December. Aspern returned to the shipyard in 1913 to have new wireless equipment installed. During the First Balkan War, an international fleet was composed to blockade Montenegro over its occupation of the port of Scutari. Aspern was sent as part of the Austro-Hungarian contingent, departing Pola on 20 March and arrived off Herceg Novi, Montenegro, the next day. She rotated on and off blockade duty until the end of the war on 30 May.

The Reichsmarineamt decided that the ship should be rebuilt into a minelaying cruiser, and so over the course of 1911–1912, she was converted for that purpose. Two of her amidships 10.5 cm guns were removed and two 50 cm (20 in) deck-mounted torpedo tubes were installed, along with provisions to carry 200 naval mines. The latter necessitated cutting down her main deck aft, where the mines would be dropped into the sea. Arcona was recommissioned on 31 October 1912 and was assigned to the Coastal Artillery and Mine Weapons Inspectorate.

In 1959, the village of Ironton, one of the creditors for the village of Manganese, petitioned Crow Wing County for the community's dissolution. Einer R. Anderson, then Crow Wing County Auditor, was appointed as its receiver, and creditors of the village of Manganese were given six months to file a claim. Notices sent via registered mail to the last known village officers were refused and returned.

Nalder said that computer modelling was used to determine where to place the acoustic matting, based on ground conditions, geography and track geometry. He also said that the PTA would monitor noise and vibrations over the coming months. On 12 October 2014, 50 residents gathered around the railway line to protest against the vibrations. Opposition leader Mark McGowan, Member for Butler John Quigley and Shadow Transport Minister Ken Travers attended the protest as well. McGowan said that the 850 metres (2,790 ft) of matting was not enough. Nalder reiterated that the government was undertaking vibration monitoring. In December 2014, the results on noise monitoring were released. The monitoring found that noise and vibration levels near Butler station were within acceptable standards, but noise and vibrations were above acceptable levels at Kilkee Street, near Nowergup depot. The PTA said that a larger earth noise wall would be built there.\n\nBefore opening, the projected patronage for the station was 2,000 people per day. The station reached that patronage nine days after opening. In August 2015, the station had 2,022 daily boardings, with a total of 600,000 in its first year of operation. Boardings on buses in the surrounding area were also up by 13% compared to before the station opened.

Determined to help develop scientific research in China, he accepted a research professorship at the medical school of the National Central University in Nanjing, and later joined the Medical Institute of Academia Sinica in 1948. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Wang became deputy director of the newly established Shanghai Institute of Physiology and Biochemistry, under director Bei Shizhang. In 1955, he was among the first group of scientists to be elected to the newly established Chinese Academy of Sciences. In 1958, he established the Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and served as its director until his retirement in 1984. In these capacities, he recruited many prominent Chinese scientists from abroad, including future academicians Cao Tianqin, Chen-Lu Tsou (Zou Chenglu), Wang Debao and Niu Jingyi. Wang's most significant contribution was the total chemical synthesis of insulin. He started the project in 1958 with a team of scientists, who first synthesized the 20 amino acids that constitute proteins, and then used them to produce chains of insulin. His team successfully synthesized insulin in 1965, the first in the world to do so. It was a major breakthrough to produce a biologically active compound from inorganic chemicals. Many scientists, including the Nobel Prize committee member Arne Tiselius and Physics laureate Chen-Ning Yang, believed Wang's total synthesis of insulin was worthy of a Nobel Prize. However, the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976) intervened and the Chinese Communist government considered the Nobel Prize a symbol of Western decadence. Instead, Wang was held a virtual prisoner in a building at his institute and forced to study Mao Zedong thought. He was unable to conduct research for most of the ten years. During an interview in 1986, Wang told The Straits Times that \"we were like the proverbial hare which took a long nap while others were not like the tortoise\". After the end of the Cultural Revolution, Wang and his team resumed their work and achieved the synthesis from inorganic chemicals of a transfer RNA (tRNA), another significant biological molecule, in the late 1970s. Wang established several training programs for young biochemists, many of whom later became accomplished scientists, including academicians Li Zaiping, Xu Genjun, Hong Guofan, Liu Xinyuan, and Wang Enduo. ### Awards\n\nIn 1988, William Joseph Whelan, the founder of the Miami Winter Symposium for Biotechnology, created the Special Achievement Award of the symposium and presented the first award to Wang. In 1996, he was nominated by many scientists for the Ho Leung Ho Lee Prize for Achievement in Science and Technology. When he won the award with its prize money of one million yuan, he used it to fund a scholarship for graduate students at the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n\n ## Personal life\n\nWang met Liu Runling (刘润苓), a student at Yenching University, when he was recuperating from tuberculosis in Beijing. They married and had two sons, Wang Jiahu (王家槲) and Wang Jianan (王家楠). Liu worked as a teacher and started a kindergarten. She suffered from Alzheimer's disease in old age and died in 1992.\n\nWang died in Shanghai on 5 May 2001, aged 93.

A new UNLF government was installed, but it was weak and exercised little control over the country. This was in part due to the UNLF's and its army's own internal divisions. The several-hundred strong Kikosi Maalum group was loyal to Milton Obote, who had served as President before Amin took power. Yoweri Museveni controlled the Front for National Salvation, which had about 3,000 members. Over time power shifted to pro-Obote elements in the government and the army. Obote assumed power in 1980 through a disputed election, and ruled through repressive methods, including the incarceration and killing of dissidents. In February 1981 Museveni and a small band of rebels began attacking UNLA forces, signalling their entry in the Ugandan Bush War. Shortly thereafter a new rebel coalition was organised as the National Resistance Movement (NRM). Museveni was made Vice-Chairman of the National Resistance Council, the group's political body, and Chairman of the High Command of the National Resistance Army (NRA), the Movement's armed organ. By July 1985 the NRA had been largely defeated and pushed out of its strongholds, and Museveni retired to Sweden. On 27 July, several officers of the UNLA launched a coup which overthrew President Obote. General Tito Okello assumed power in his place. The new regime was weak and unstable, and Okello made overtures to anti-Obote rebel groups to form a coalition government and end the fighting. The coup upset many Lango soldiers, which constituted the second-largest ethnic group in the UNLA and were loyal to Obote. The NRM was highly critical of the new government and accused the UNLA of committing atrocities. The UNLF, conscious of its weakening political position, nevertheless pursued negotiations with the NRM. Museveni took advantage of the disruption caused by the coup to return to East Africa and rebuild the NRA. In August the NRA launched a series of co-ordinated attacks that resulted in the capture of significant amounts of territory in central and western Uganda.","prompt":"Who assumed power after the coup that overthrew President Obote in July 1985?","answer":"General Tito Okello.","generation":"After the coup in July 1985 that overthrew President Milton Obote, General Tito Okello assumed power in Uganda.

The game's worldwide settings were influenced by the need for a significant new feature despite the Genesis's technology having been pushed to its limit. The game was positively received by critics and commercially successful; critics appreciated the refined gameplay and visuals, but pointed out a lack of innovation, and had mixed reactions to the audio.\n\n","prompt":"Who developed and published Road Rash 3 for the Sega Genesis?","answer":"Electronic Arts (EA)","generation":"Road Rash 3 for the Sega Genesis was developed and published by Electronic Arts.","run_id":"task_1_run_6","is_correct":false,"is_hallucinated":true}

He noted that the cap was \"chocolate color, fleshy, and so succulent that it is difficult to dry and preserve\". The name assigned by Frost, however, is an illegitimate homonym of a name previously used for a different species by Miles Joseph Berkeley in 1851. Charles Horton Peck published the new name Boletus eximius for the same species in 1887. William Alphonso Murrill transferred the species to Ceriomyces in 1909, but this genus is no longer recognized, having largely been subsumed into Boletus. Various authorities have treated the taxon as either a Boletus, Leccinum, or Tylopilus, depending on which morphological characteristics they deemed most significant. Rolf Singer initially considered the species most appropriately placed in Tylopilus on account of the reddish-brown spore print, a taxonomic opinion shared by Alexander H. Smith and Harry Thiers, who wrote \"Concerning whether or not the species should be placed in Leccinum, we can only say that the color of the stipe ornamentation is merely a reflection of the color of the stipe generally and that it does not change color in a characteristic pattern as it ages. For this reason we exclude it from Leccinum and agree with Singer that it is a Tylopilus.\" Later however, Singer thought the somewhat scabrous ornamentation of the stipe justified a placement in Leccinum. René Pomerleau had previously (1959) placed the species in Leccinum, but this transfer was invalid, as no basionym was specified. Roy E. Halling designated a lectotype specimen in 1983 from Frost's original collections. Early molecular evidence suggested that the lilac-brown bolete was genetically distinct from the genera in which it had formerly been placed. In 2012, Halling and colleagues published molecular evidence indicating that the species did not belong in either Tylopilus or Leccinum as it does not share a recent common ancestor with either of those genera. Recognizing its genetic and morphological distinctiveness, they created the genus Sutorius, with S.eximius as the type species. As of 2015, the only other species in Sutorius is S.australiensis, found in Australia. The generic name Sutorius is derived for the Latin word for \"cobbler\" (sutor), referring to Charles Frost's profession. The epithet eximius means \"distinguished\" or \"excellent in size and beauty\". Although Frost's reason for using this name is not known with certainty, Peter Roberts and Shelley Evans speculate \"Perhaps it was the violet-brown colors, which are quite attractive in a formal, nineteenth-century manner.\" S.eximius is commonly known as the \"lilac-brown bolete\".","prompt":"What is the type species of the genus Sutorius?","answer":"Sutorius eximius","generation":"The type species of the genus Sutorius is Sutorius eximius.

She stated that although singing songs written by someone else might not feel less personal, \"It's special to be on the stage and actually sing something you had done.\" With respect to her involvement in the songwriting process, Annie referred to herself as \"a bit of a control freak\". The lyrics of Anniemal generally describe falling in or out of love. Annie's vocals are thin and breathy, working within a narrow vocal range. Reviewers noted a sense of melancholy in the vocals, suggesting that it could be attributed to the death of Kroknes. Annie acknowledged that none of the songs \"are directly happy\" and that some are \"happy but still a bit melancholy.\" She stated that she thought bittersweet melodies \"[sound] timeless...Very Scandinavian of me!\" She insisted, however, that she tries to write songs that are cheerful: > \"For me, it's really easy to write depressive songs and that's why I never do that.

She stated that she wanted to make a pop album that would not quickly become dated, \"an album that you could listen to in five years and it wouldn't sound terrible.\" Annie considered excluding \"Greatest Hit\" from Anniemal to achieve this but ultimately included it because she felt it did not sound as if it were five years old.","prompt":"Which 1982 song by Shakatak is sampled in \"No Easy Love\" on the album \"Anniemal\"?","answer":"Easier Said Than Done","generation":"The 1982 song by Shakatak that is sampled in \"No Easy Love\" on the album \"Anniemal\" by Annie is \"Easier Said Than Done.\"","run_id":"task_1_run_6","is_correct":true,"is_hallucinated":false}

In August 1962, Miller addressed approximately 2,200 delegates of the state's Republican convention at the Charleston Civic Center. Miller's speech was praised by columnists in the Beckley Post-Herald and the Charleston Daily Mail. In his speech, he noted that while he believed the Republican Party had something to offer all groups, he warned the party against making separate appeals to different groups and to prejudices. In March 1968, McDowell County Criminal Court judge L. R. Morgan died, causing a vacancy on the bench. On April 9, 1968, Miller was elected and appointed by the McDowell County Bar Association to serve as special judge of the criminal court for the April term until Governor Hulett C. Smith appointed Morgan's successor. Governor Smith subsequently appointed Harry G. Camper to replace Morgan until a permanent replacement for the remainder of Morgan's term could be elected in the 1968 election in November 1968. Neither the Democratic or Republican parties held primary elections for nominees to the seat, and therefore, neither party entered a candidate for the November ballot. A write-in campaign was then organized for Miller and Beediah Hassan, and stickers for both candidates were disseminated to voters on the day of the election—November 5, 1968.

In 1964, British news channel ITV Studios were interested in producing a television special about Bacharach titled The Bacharach Sound, after which he flew to London with his fiancé Angie Dickinson, an actress with filmmaking knowledge. At The Dorchester hotel, Dickinson met producer Charles K. Feldman, who was involved with Woody Allen in a new movie project, What's New Pussycat? (1965). Being shown a picture of Bacharach by Dickinson, Feldman became interested in working with him after hearing promising words about his songwriting, as Dickinson would state that \"he [Bacharach] was a genius in my mind\" even though she was unsure of whether he had scored film music before. David and Bacharach were already composing music for a contemporary movie, Made in Paris (1966) and were afraid they wouldn't have time for both projects at once; this issue was solved when they had an agent hired by John Heyman, who believed What's New Pussycat? was the better deal. Allegedly, Bacharach was unaware of this meeting until he only had three weeks left to compose music for the film. \"My Little Red Book\" was among the first songs they composed for the movie, being written before the movie's title track, composed during the Easter of 1965; Dickinson states that the first songs written for the project were \"My Little Red Book\", \"Here I Am\" and \"some Russian thing\". As usual, David wrote the lyrics for the song while Bacharach composed the music. The song lyrically refers to a man missing his previous girlfriend, though in a vain effort to get over her, \"goes from A to Z in his red book\", implied to be a telephone directory or an \"affectionate journal detailing girls he admired.\" According to Manfred Mann vocalist Paul Jones, the lyrics were some of the most clever he sang: > \"The lyric is so good.

Its specific name is derived from the Latin axilla, meaning \"armpit\", relating to the dark patches under the wings. He reported the description came from a bird that had been kept for two months in the early colony. The species description was based on one of four paintings by Australian painter Thomas Watling of a bird in the Sydney district in the 1790s. English naturalist John Gould described the same species as Elanus notatus in 1838 from a specimen from New South Wales, apparently unaware of Latham's description. English zoologist George Robert Gray followed Latham using the binomial Elanus axillaris in 1849. Gould conceded Latham's name was valid and hence had precedence, and E.notatus was reduced to synonymy. Australian ornithologist Gregory Mathews argued that Latham's description mentioned black axillaries and hence must have referred to the letter-winged kite, and that Watling's drawings were inconclusive. He promoted the use of E.notatus over E.axillaris in 1916. This was followed for many years. But in 1980 Australian taxonomists Richard Schodde and Ian J. Mason refuted Mathews' claim that the original description of E.axillaris was ambiguous and reinstated the name. This has been followed by subsequent authorities. The black-shouldered kite has no recognised subspecies. \"Black-shouldered kite\" has been designated the official English name by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC). It has also been called the Australian black-shouldered kite to distinguish it from the Eurasian black-winged kite (E.caeruleus) and American white-tailed kite (E.leucurus)—both formerly known as \"black-shouldered kite\". Watling had recorded the Dharug term Geo-ga-rack. In 1959, American ornithologist Kenneth C. Parkes noted that the plumage of the black-shouldered kite is similar to that of the black-winged and white-tailed kites, and proposed that all three were subspecies of a single cosmopolitan species E.caeruleus—much like the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus). Researchers William S. Clark and Richard C. Banks disputed this, pointing out the differences in anatomical proportions such as wing shape and tail length, and hunting behavior (E.caeruleus rarely hunts by hovering, unlike the other two species) and proposed the species be separated again in 1992. They are regarded as distinct in the IOC World Bird List. Molecular evidence shows that the black-shouldered kite and its relatives belong to a subfamily Elaninae that is an early offshoot within the raptor family Accipitridae. There is some evidence they are more divergent from other raptors and better placed in their own family.","prompt":"What is the official English name designated by the International Ornithologists' Union for the bird species Elanus axillaris?","answer":"Black-shouldered kite","generation":"The official English name designated by the International Ornithologists' Union for the bird species Elanus axillaris is the \"Black-shouldered Kite.\"","run_id":"task_1_run_6","is_correct":true,"is_hallucinated":false}

Between 1830 and 1832, while living in Montreal, Cadron-Jetté was visited at her house in the middle of the night by a prostitute who was seeking asylum from two sailors with intentions of violence. Cadron-Jetté hid the woman for the night in her cellar, fed her, and counselled her to change her way of life. Subsequently Cadron-Jetté received a letter from the woman informing her the woman had emigrated to the United States and made positive changes to her life, including marriage. In any case, during her time in Montreal, Cadron-Jetté made the acquaintance of Ignace Bourget, Bishop of the Diocese of Montreal. She met Bourget through her attendance at Saint Jacques Cathedral, where he became her spiritual director. Cadron-Jetté joined his Archiconfrérie du Très Saint et Immaculé Coeur de Marie, a group formed by Bourget to pray for the conversion of sinners. Beginning in 1840, Bourget began to call upon Cadron-Jetté to find crisis accommodation for unwed mothers who had approached him for confession and help. This accommodation was to be secret, as unwed mothers carried a significant social stigma at the time and were often the targets of hostility, and it was to be \"with a kind and prayerful woman\". Cadron-Jetté undertook this work, and between 1840 and 1845 helped around 25 women during their pregnancy, childbirth, and recovery. She would often place the women with her (now-independent) children, and sometimes offered the women accommodation in her own home. After the birth of each child, Cadron-Jetté would take the newborn to be baptised at Montreal's Notre Dame church, and stand as godmother for the child. In 1845, in response to growing demand brought about by Montreal's burgeoning population, Bourget began an organised project to assist unwed mothers in need of crisis accommodation and medical care. Although the Grey Nuns had been doing work in this area since 1754, their efforts were limited to the care of illegitimate newborns, and no services existed to aid the unwed mothers themselves.","prompt":"Who became Marie-Rosalie Cadron-Jetté's spiritual director while she lived in Montreal?","answer":"Ignace Bourget","generation":"While living in Montreal, Marie-Rosalie Cadron-Jetté's spiritual director was Ignace Bourget, who was the Bishop of Montreal at the time.","run_id":"task_1_run_6","is_correct":true,"is_hallucinated":false}

As a consequence, the entire class, including U-10, was sold to the German Imperial Navy in November 1914. Under German control, the class became known as the U 66 type and the boats were renumbered; U-10 became U-69, and all were redesigned and reconstructed to German specifications.

In 1942, the writers of Der Weltkrieg, the German official history (volume XIII), wrote that since mid-July, the German defences at Lens and for about 4.3 mi (7 km) to the north had been under bombardment, which became more intense in August because Haig wanted a diversion from the offensive in Flanders. On 15 August, the Canadian Corps attacked the German positions from Lens to about 1 mi (2 km) north, took an important height [Hill 70] for observation and pushed beyond the First Position (I Stellung). Counter-attacks recaptured pockets of ground but the Canadians could not be expelled from I Stellung. Fighting continued intermittently until 24 August but did not lead to more significant changes. The Canadians took over 1,100 prisoners and in their counter-attacks the Germans over 1,002 prisoners. In 1981, Sydney Wise, author of the Royal Canadian Air Force official history, called the attack at Hill 70 \"a demonstration of how a set-piece attack should be carried out\". The Germans refrained from attempts to recapture the lost ground at Lens, due to the need to avoid diverting resources from the Third Battle of Ypres in Flanders, the main strategic effort on the Western Front by both sides. In 2009, Tim Cook wrote that the Canadian attack had crushed the defenders by 18 August, 21 German counter-attacks being repulsed. The Canadian plan had succeeded but had depended on the determination of the Canadian infantry against equally determined opponents, who suffered approximately 20,000 casualties, against 5,600 Canadian. The attack ended on 25 August and was a considerable victory despite the Germans retaining their hold on occupation of Lens. Two German divisions intended for Flanders had been diverted to Hill 70 and the reinforcement plan for the fighting at Ypres had been dislocated. Cook called the battle the most one-sided German defeat apart from the Battle of Messines in June.

According to the U.S. National Geodetic Survey, Rocky Butte has an elevation of 613 feet (187 m). It is surrounded on almost all sides by the Portland Delta. With a variable topography, the Portland area ranges from river valley floors to terraces reaching elevations of 400 feet (120 m). The Willamette Valley is separated within by hills reaching heights more than 1,000 feet (300 m), and it is also physically separated from the lower Columbia River valley. The Columbia River flows west from the eastern Portland region, merging with the Willamette near Portland before moving north. Tributaries for the Willamette include the Pudding, Molalla, Tualatin, Abernethy, and Clackamas Rivers, while the Washougal and Sandy Rivers mark notable tributaries for the Columbia River.

The area typically does not experience frost, with more than 200 frost-free days annually. Temperature can vary widely, reaching a historic maximum of 107 °F (42 °C), though the usual July maximum is below 80 °F (27 °C), and the average minimum for January is above 32 °F (0 °C). Yearly, precipitation averages between 35 and 45 inches (89 and 114 cm) in most river valleys, with a mean of 42.04 inches (106.8 cm) from 1871 through 1952.

However, the short central hall at Universytet was inadequate for the high volume of passengers that a transfer station would be subject to, thus the station's future location was moved a few city blocks to coincide with a newly proposed station of the Sviatoshynsko-Brovarska Line. This new station, called Teatralna, would be located in between the Khreshchatyk and Universytet stations, and would serve as a transfer to the future Zoloti Vorota station. Although the Kominternivska station was never built, some of its architectural designs were preserved and used in the creation of the Teatralna station. Construction for the Syretsko-Pecherska Line, the Kyiv Metro system's third line, began on 23 February 1983. It had a projected date of completion in 1986, although the line's opening was delayed until the end of 1989 due to the economic state of the Soviet Union at the time. The line's first segment was officially opened on 31 December 1989, and consisted of three stations; Zoloti Vorota–Palats Sportu–Mechnikova (named Klovska today). Since its entrance is located on a hillside, two separate escalator tunnels had to be created, connected by an underground station vestibule. The upper tunnel is 35 m (115 ft) long, while the lower tunnel is 56 m (184 ft) long. The vestibule was built in the same way as with other stations of the Kyiv Metro system; it was first completed at ground level, and then lowered to its final location underground. The vestibule is a 20 m (66 ft) tall monolithic dome with an approximately similar diameter. The installation began in November 1987 and was completed by 1988, lowered at a pace of half a meter a day. Since the construction took place in water-saturated soils, over 200 frozen wells had to be formed so it could be lowered to its proper location. In addition, over 250 m<sup>2<\/sup> (300 sq yd) of rock had to be removed to make way for the vestibule. After it was finally installed, construction work began on the lower escalator tunnel. Due to a difficult hydrogeology, the tunnel was not completed by the station's grand opening and until 1 May 1990, it could only be reached with a transfer from the Teatralna station. For several years, the Zoloti Vorota station served as the line's northern terminus. Continued construction extended the line northwards to the Lukianivska station. In between the two stations, the Lvivska Brama station was built during the late 1990s; however, it has not been completed to this day.","prompt":"What is the name of the station where a transfer to the future Zoloti Vorota station would be located?","answer":"Teatralna","generation":"The transfer to the future Zoloti Vorota station would be located at the Teatralna station on the Kyiv Metro.","run_id":"task_1_run_6","is_correct":true,"is_hallucinated":false}

According to lead singer Bart Millard, the label figured that the book could introduce the band and set up a successful career. Although the band did not want to write the song, they eventually relented. \"Bless Me Indeed (Jabez's Song)\" was written by Jim Bryson, Nathan Cochran, Bart Millard, Mike Scheuchzer, and Robby Shaffer - all five members of MercyMe at the time. Like the rest of Almost There, it was recorded at Ivy Park, The Indigo Room, Paradise Sound, and IBC Studios. Kipley produced and programmed the song, while Skye McCaskey and Julian Kindred engineered it. Salvo mixed the song. String instruments were recorded by the Paltrow Performance Group.\n\n\"Bless Me Indeed (Jabez's Song)\" has a length of four minutes and fourteen seconds. According to the sheet music published by Musicnotes.com, it is in set common time in the key of C major and has a tempo of 108 beats per minute. Bart Millard's vocal range in the song spans from the low note of G<sub>4<\/sub> to the high note of F<sub>5<\/sub>. The song lyrically relates to the Biblical figure Jabez. In 1 Chronicles 4:10, Jabez requests that God bless him by expanding his territory and keeping him free from evil, a request God accepts. In \"Bless Me Indeed (Jabez's Song)\", Millard requests the same from God.\n\n ## Reception\n\n\"Bless Me Indeed\" received a mixed to positive response from critics. Steve Losey of AllMusic selected it as a 'track pick'. The J Man of Crosswalk.com described it as a \"winner\", and appreciated that it was based on The Prayer of Jabez. In Amazon.com's product description of Almost There, the reviewer stated the track \"is a glimmer of brilliance where the group brings it all together\". However, Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today described the song as \"[not] particularly remarkable\", preferring another song based on Jabez, According to John's \"Song of Jabez\". In an interview in 2014, Millard stated that it is one of \"one of the worst songs we’ve ever done\".\n\n ## Chart performance\n\n\"Bless Me Indeed\" was released as the first single from Almost There. Although the label anticipated the song's connection with The Prayer of Jaebz would make it a success, it performed poorly on Christian radio. The song debuted at number 29 on the Radio & Records Christian AC chart for the week of August 31, 2001. The following week, it advanced to its peak of number 27. The song spent four weeks on the chart before dropping off. The poor performance of the song at radio led to initial album sales that were lower than anticipated, although the album would later be certified triple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) following the success of the album's second single, \"I Can Only Imagine\".\n\n ## Credits and personnel\n\nCredits from the album liner notes)\n\nMercyMe\n\n- Bart Millard – lead vocals\n- Mike Scheuchzer – guitars\n- Jim Bryson – keys\n- Nathan Cochran – bass guitar, background vocals\n- Robby Shaffer – drums\n\nAdditional performers\n\n- Paltrow Performance Group – strings\n\nTechnical\/Misc.\n\n- Peter Kipley – producer, programmer\n- Steve McCaskey – engineer\n- Julian Kindred – engineer\n- Salvo – mixing\n- Shane Wilson – mixing\n- Elizabeth Workman – design\n- Shawn Sanders – band photos\n\n ## Charts","prompt":"Who produced and programmed \"Bless Me Indeed (Jabez's Song)\"?","answer":"Peter Kipley","generation":"\"Bless Me Indeed (Jabez's Song)\" was produced and programmed by David Smallbone and Steve Kipner.","run_id":"task_1_run_7","is_correct":false,"is_hallucinated":true}

The head is very short, wide, and flattened, with a blunt snout. The horizontally oval eyes are placed high on the head and have thick ridges beneath; each has a rudimentary nictitating membrane and is followed by a spiracle. The nostrils are preceded by triangular flaps of skin that almost reach the long, angular mouth. The mouth contains prominent papillae on both the roof and the floor, and lacks furrows at the corners. The upper and lower jaws contain on average 65 and 60 tooth rows respectively; each tooth is relatively large, with a narrow central cusp flanked by 1–2 smaller cusplets. There are five pairs of gill slits.\n\nThe pectoral fins are rather long and broad. The first dorsal fin originates over the rear of the pelvic fin bases; the second dorsal fin is slightly larger and originates over the rear of the anal fin base. The pelvic and anal fins are long and low, and larger than the dorsal fins. The free rear tips of the pelvic fins may be fused together to some degree, but never completely; males have slender, pointed claspers. The caudal peduncle is long and thin, particularly in younger sharks. The caudal fin makes up one-fourth to one-fifth of the total length and has a weak lower lobe and a ventral notch near the tip of the upper lobe. The thick skin is covered by well-calcified dermal denticles, except around the gill slits. Enlarged, spike-like denticles are found on the upper surface of the pectoral fins and along the dorsal midline from the snout to the second dorsal fin origin. Juvenile Izak catsharks are boldly patterned with many irregularly shaped dark brown spots on a light yellow to yellowish brown background. The spots enlarge and fuse with age to form an intricate pattern of reticulations and U-shaped markings in adults. The underside is plain white, with obvious black sensory pores beneath the head, body, and paired fins.

American cruiser Frederick served as escort for the assembled ships, which were the 35th U.S. convoy of the war. During the voyage—because of the inability to finish serving three meals for all the men during daylight hours—mess service was curtailed to two daily meals, a practice continued on later voyages. On 20 May the convoy sighted and fired on a \"submarine\" that turned out to be a bucket; the next day escort Frederick left the convoy after being relieved by nine destroyers. Three days later the convoy sighted land at 06:30 and anchored at Brest that afternoon. Princess Matoika sailed for Newport News and arrived there safely on 6 June with Pastores and Lenape. Fate, however, was not as kind to former convoy mates President Lincoln and Dwinsk. On their return journeys they were sunk by German submarines U-90 and U-151, respectively. After loading officers and men from the 29th Infantry Division on 13 June Princess Matoika set sail from Newport News the next day with Wilhelmina, Pastores, Lenape, and British troopship . On the morning of 16 June lookouts on Princess Matoika spotted a submarine and, soon after, a torpedo heading directly for the ship. The torpedo missed her by a few yards and gunners manning the ship's 6-inch (150 mm) guns claimed a hit on the sub with their second shot.","prompt":"What was the name of the American cruiser that served as an escort for the 35th U.S. convoy involving USS Princess Matoika?","answer":"Frederick","generation":"The American cruiser that served as an escort for the 35th U.S. convoy involving the USS Princess Matoika was USS St. Louis (C-20\/CA-18).","run_id":"task_1_run_7","is_correct":false,"is_hallucinated":true}

He played as a halfback for the LSU Tigers football team of Louisiana State University, where he was notable for his passing skills and play-making ability, which earned him the nickname \"Miracle Mickal\". He was also the team's primary punter and placekicker. A three-time All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) selection, Mickal led LSU to an undefeated season in 1933 and a conference championship and Sugar Bowl in 1935. In 1936, Mickal played quarterback for a college all-star team that was the first team of college players to defeat a professional team. Although selected in the 1936 NFL Draft, he did not play professionally. Mickal was a charter member of the LSU Athletic Hall of Fame in 1937 and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1967.\n\nIn addition to football, Mickal was a cadet in LSU's Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC), was a member of the pre-med club and debate team, and as a senior was president of the university's student body. While a student, he was offered a seat in the Louisiana State Senate by U.S. Senator and noted LSU supporter Huey Long, which he declined. He earned his medical degree in 1940, and after serving in World War II began a lifelong career in obstetrics and gynecology. He served as head professor of the LSU Medical School OB\/GYN department for over twenty years. Actively involved in various university affairs during and after his time as a student, Mickal was honored as LSU's \"Alumnus of the Year\" in 1980.\n\n ## Early life and education\n\nMickal was born in the Levant in an area that is today part of Lebanon. He immigrated with his family to the United States in 1920, where they arrived on Ellis Island. He settled in McComb, Mississippi and attended McComb High School, where he played football, baseball, and basketball and ran track. His father Kalil, who ran a local general store, was initially against his son playing sports. \"It was an old Lebanese custom,\" Mickal later explained, \"that the eldest son take over the business. My father wasn't aware that I was playing.\" His father was eventually persuaded by the townspeople to let his son play. During his senior year, he was recruited by LSU and Notre Dame to play football, and ultimately chose the Tigers after the death of Notre Dame head coach Knute Rockne.\n\n ## College\n\nMickal was an all-around player; a triple-threat running back who also played on defense. He was regarded as an excellent deep-ball passer; in the words of LSU coach Lawrence \"Biff\" Jones: \"Mickal is a greater passer than Red Cagle—he's the greatest I ever saw.\" Jones was Cagle's coach while at Army. One sportswriter referred to Mickal as \"the Dizzy Dean of the nation's forward passers.\" He was also known for his play-making ability during crucial moments of games, and LSU compiled a win–loss record of 23–4–5 in the three seasons Mickal played for the team.\n\n ### 1933\n\nMickal showed his versatility in the first game of the 1933 season against Rice, tossing a 40-yard pass on the first play from scrimmage to end Pete Burge and booting punts of 76 and 61 yards. In week four against Arkansas Mickal completed touchdown passes of 48 and 57 yards and ran for a 15-yard touchdown, as he was responsible for every score in the 20–0 win over the eventual Southwest Conference champion Razorbacks. He scored the only touchdown of LSU's final game of the season, against Tennessee, with a goal line dive into the end zone. He also kicked the extra point for the 7–0 victory, and completed the season having successfully made every extra point he attempted. The Tigers finished undefeated with three ties in their first season as members of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). After the season, Mickal was named to the United Press (UP) All-SEC second team as a halfback.\n\n","prompt":"What nickname was Abe Mickal known by due to his passing skills and play-making ability?","answer":"Miracle Mickal","generation":"Abe Mickal was known by the nickname \"Miracle Mickal\" due to his exceptional passing skills and play-making ability.","run_id":"task_1_run_7","is_correct":true,"is_hallucinated":false}

After several months in beta, it was released for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in May 2019, and for Windows and Stadia in November 2019. A standalone client for the game was released in December 2020. In Red Dead Online, players control a customizable silent protagonist who is freed from prison after being framed for murder, and tasked with taking revenge in exchange for proving their innocence. Set in 1898, one year before the events of Red Dead Redemption 2, the game comprises story missions where up to four players can complete tasks to advance the narrative, as well as various side missions and events.\n\nLike the single-player game, Red Dead Online is presented through both first and third-person perspectives, and players may freely roam in its interactive open world. Gameplay elements include shootouts, hunting, horseback riding, interacting with non-player characters, and maintaining the character's honor rating through moral choices and deeds. A bounty system governs the response of law enforcement and bounty hunters to crimes committed by players. Players can traverse the open world alone or in a posse of up to seven players, with or against whom they can partake in organized activities. Developed in tandem with the single-player story, Red Dead Online was viewed as a separate product despite the development team's wishes to translate elements of the single-player to a multiplayer environment. The team took lessons learned from the multiplayer of Red Dead Redemption and Grand Theft Auto Online.\n\nRed Dead Online received criticism at launch for its balancing of gameplay and in-game currency; later updates addressed the issues. It received positive responses with praise for its presentation of missions, co-operative events, and technical improvements. Like Grand Theft Auto Online, the game received several updates adding new content, including various roles players can select to earn additional rewards. Reception to post-release content was generally positive, with praise directed at the more significant additions, though the lack of new content over time led to some criticism and backlash. The final major update was released in July 2021, as Rockstar later withdrew development resources to focus on the next Grand Theft Auto game.\n\n","prompt":"When was the final major update for Red Dead Online released?","answer":"July 2021","generation":"The final major update for Red Dead Online was released on July 13, 2021.

Such a formation was common at the time at both the college and professional levels, as teams sought to emulate the success the Chicago Bears had with the formation over the previous decade. The Million Dollar Backfield began its construction in 1948 with the team's signing of speedy fullback Joe Perry. In 1951 the 49ers drafted quarterback Y. A. Tittle. Tittle had played the previous three seasons with the Baltimore Colts, and became available in that year's draft after the Colts folded. The next year the 49ers drafted halfback Hugh McElhenny in the first round. McElhenny proved to be an explosive play-maker and was recognized as the NFL's rookie of the year in 1952. All three were invited to play in the Pro Bowl for 1953, comprising the starting offensive backfield for the West. The final piece came in 1954, when John Henry Johnson joined the team. Johnson became known for his powerful running and his blocking, which served to complement the finesse of Perry and McElhenny. The \"Million Dollar Backfield\" moniker was first applied by 49ers public relations man Dan McGuire to describe the collective talent of the backfield. Despite the name, not even when combined did the players' salaries approach the million dollar figure. In reality, at the time, players often took off-season jobs to supplement their income; Tittle launched his own insurance agency while with the 49ers, and McElhenny worked as a salesman for the Granny Goose potato chip company. Johnson, who never made more than \\$40,000 (\\$361,000 in 2017 dollars) in a season, joked in 1987 that he was \"still looking for the million.\" For three seasons, the backfield challenged opposing defenses with Tittle's arm, Johnson's power, the speed of Perry, and the elusiveness of McElhenny. \"There was no greater running backs than Hugh McElhenny, John Henry Johnson and Joe Perry in the same backfield,\" Tittle reminisced.","prompt":"What nickname was given to the 49ers' backfield featuring players like Joe Perry and Hugh McElhenny in the 1950s?","answer":"Million Dollar Backfield","generation":"The 49ers' backfield in the 1950s, featuring players like Joe Perry, Hugh McElhenny, John Henry Johnson, and Y.A.

On the night of June 28, McClellan told his generals he intended to move his army to a position on the north bank of the James River called Harrison's Landing, where they would be protected by Union gunboats. The Army of the Potomac came to Malvern Hill, the army's final stop before reaching the Landing, with approximately 54,000 men. On the morning of June 30, 1862, the Union V Corps under Fitz John Porter, a part of McClellan's Army of the Potomac, amassed atop Malvern Hill. Col. Henry Hunt, McClellan's skilled chief of artillery, posted 171 guns on the hill and 91 more in reserve in the south. The artillery line on the hill's slope consisted of eight batteries of field artillery with 37 guns. Brig. Gen. George Sykes's division would guard the line. In reserve were additional field artillery and three batteries of heavy artillery, which included five 4.5-inch (11 cm) Rodman guns, five 20-pounder (9.1 kg) Parrott rifles and six 32-pounder (15 kg) howitzers. As more of McClellan's forces arrived at the hill, Porter continued to reinforce the Union line. Brig. Gen. George Morell's units, stationed between the Crew and West farms, extended the line to the northeastern section. Brig. Gen. Darius Couch's division of the IV Corps, as yet unbloodied by the skirmishes of the Seven Days, further extended the northeastern line. This left 17,800 soldiers from Couch's and Morell's divisions at the northern face of the hill, overlooking the Quaker Road, from which the Federals expected Lee's forces to attack.

The royal anthem officially remained in place until the formal declaration of a republic in March 1970, when it was abandoned along with numerous other overt references to the Crown. Republican Rhodesia was without an anthem for over four years before the chosen music was announced on 28 August 1974: the Fourth Movement, commonly called \"Ode to Joy\", from Ludwig van Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. The fact that the Council of Europe had adopted this tune as the \"Anthem of Europe\" in January 1972 apparently did not perturb the Rhodesian government; John Sutherland and Stephen Fender comment that Rhodesia's choice proved deeply embarrassing for the UK's Labour government, whose leaders now had to respect a melody associated with Rhodesia when attending official European functions. With a tune now in place, the Rhodesian government organised a nationwide competition to write matching lyrics, the winner of which would receive a cash prize of R\\$500 (equal to about US\\$1,000). The Council of Europe, though less than pleased with Rhodesia's selection, did not object to it, reasoning that so long as Rhodesia was using \"Ode to Joy\" in its original form, it could not be subject to reproach as the music was long out of copyright and in the public domain. It did announce, however, that should Rhodesia use the same arrangement as the Council of Europe, then the author of that score, Herbert von Karajan, would have grounds for a plagiarism lawsuit. Such an incident was averted when Rhodesia adopted an original sixteen-bar arrangement by Captain Ken MacDonald, the Rhodesian African Rifles' bandmaster.

The second and third floors, which contained the theater's offices, were spanned by a large archway. Above the arch was a stone shield, with a relief of the Liberty Bell carved into it. The facade was capped by a statue of a bald eagle with spread wings. There was an ornamental cornice above the top story.

The prince's partiality for Gaveston was so extravagant that Edward I sent Gaveston into exile, but he was recalled a few months later, after the King's death led to the prince's accession as Edward II. Edward bestowed the Earldom of Cornwall on Gaveston, and arranged for him to marry Edward's niece Margaret de Clare, sister of the powerful Earl of Gloucester.\n\nGaveston's exclusive access to the King provoked several members of the nobility, and in 1308, the King was again forced to send him into exile. During this absence, he served as the King's Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. Edward managed to negotiate a deal with the opposition, however, and Gaveston returned the next year. Upon his return his behaviour became even more offensive, and, by the Ordinances of 1311, it was decided that Gaveston should be exiled for a third time, to suffer outlawry if he returned. He did however return in late 1311 and, in 1312, he was hunted down and executed by a group of magnates led by Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, and Guy de Beauchamp, 10th Earl of Warwick.\n\nIt was alleged by medieval chroniclers (as discussed below under \"Questions of sexuality\") that Edward II and Piers Gaveston were lovers, a rumour that was reinforced by later portrayals in fiction, such as Christopher Marlowe's late 16th-century play, Edward II. This assertion has received the support of some modern historians, while others have questioned it. According to Pierre Chaplais, the relationship between the two was that of an adoptive brotherhood, and Gaveston served as an unofficial deputy for a reluctant king. Other historians, like J.S. Hamilton, have pointed out that concern over the two men's sexuality was not at the core of the nobility's grievances, which rather centred on Gaveston's exclusive access to royal patronage.\n\n","prompt":"Who arranged for Piers Gaveston to marry Margaret de Clare?","answer":"Edward II","generation":"Piers Gaveston's marriage to Margaret de Clare was arranged by King Edward II of England.

In 1998, he produced and starred in Harikrishnans, co-starring Mammootty and Juhi Chawla. The film was a commercial success, but was not well received by critics. The film had dual climaxes, which were screened in different regions, based on the popularity of the two lead actors in each particular region. This, however, became controversial and took a communal turn when lawsuits were filed claiming that prints exhibited in Hindu-dominated areas showed Mohanlal marrying the heroine, whereas the ones in Muslim-dominated areas showed Mammootty marrying her. The major issue was that the film showed uncensored scenes, as the submitted cut of the film to the Central Board of Film Certification was the version in which Mohanlal wins the leading lady.

They considered 32 cm (12.6 in), 38 cm (15 in), and 40 cm (15.7 in) guns. Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, the State Secretary of the Reichsmarineamt (RMA—Imperial Naval Office), was able to use public outcry over the Agadir Crisis to pressure the Reichstag (Imperial Diet) into appropriating additional funds for the Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) to offset the additional cost of the larger weapons.

The Germans opted to make another attempt to incorporate a diesel engine to power the new ship's center propeller shaft (they had previously sought to install them on the earlier König class but they were not ready in time). The diesel engine was larger than a comparable turbine installation, increasing displacement by about 200 t (197 long tons), which required a lengthening of the hull by 2.4 m (7 ft 10 in) to keep her draft from increasing. This had the benefit of refining the hull lines and thereby improving its hydrodynamic shape, increasing her speed.

Contributors included Jere and Ray Grimm, Dick Ponzi, who won a 40-entry international competition to design the machine for Pioneer Courthouse Square (1984), and Roger Patrick Sheppard. The group described their efforts as \"collaborative\", but Sheppard considered Ponzi the \"maestro\" of the project. Ponzi did the engineering and hydraulics, and the machine was assembled at his vineyard near Beaverton. The sculpture was inspired by Portland-born-and-based writer Terence O'Donnell, who suffered from osteomyelitis during his childhood, and his \"funny Irish jig\". Weather Machine, which took five years to plan and build and cost \\$60,000, was installed in the square in August 1988. Today weatherman Willard Scott broadcast live from the square to dedicate the sculpture on its August 24 opening. Two thousand people were present as early as 4 a.m. for the dedication. Financial contributors included Pete and Mary Mark, the AT&T Foundation, Alyce R. Cheatham, Alexandra MacColl, E. Kimbark MacColl, Meier & Frank, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, David Pugh and Standard Insurance Company. Information about the donors was included on a plaque added to the sculpture's stem in the weeks following the dedication. Each day at noon, the columnar machine performs a two-minute sequence that begins with a trumpet fanfare of the opening bars of Aaron Copland's Fanfare for the Common Man, and produces mist and flashing lights. It eventually reveals one of three metal symbols: a stylized golden sun (\"helia\") for clear and sunny weather, a blue heron (Portland's official bird) for drizzle and transitional weather, or mist and a \"fierce, open-mouthed\" dragon for heavy rain or stormy weather. The fanciful symbols change at the same time every day, representing weather predictions for the following 24-hour period. \"Helia\", described as \"gleaming\", was designed by Jere Grimm; her design would later be applied to one of her husband's pots, exhibited in 1989.

Many reviewers thought the game lacked originality and believed placing the characters in planes was not enough to set it apart from other kart racing games on the GBA. GameSpy and Nintendo World Report (NWR) noted the planes still had behaviours traditionally associated with go-karts, such as slowing down when not on the track. NWR also argued the manoeuvres the planes could do were worthless and did not add anything to the experience. Eurogamer thought the planes made the game feel more 3D but reduced it to favouring luck over skill. Additionally, NWR believed Banjo-Pilot lacked what made Rare's prior racing games R. C. Pro-Am (1988) and Diddy Kong Racing great, while VideoGamer.com wrote that removing Nintendo characters and the tilt controls prevented the game from bringing innovation to the kart racing genre. The game was often labelled a clone of Nintendo's Mario Kart games. While critics generally felt Banjo-Pilot was one of the better Mario Kart clones—Cubed3 and IGN both called it the second-best GBA racer after Mario Kart: Super Circuit (2001)—they wrote that players would be better off playing a game from that series. Eurogamer thought players should try Banjo-Pilot before deciding to buy it, and GameSpy and VideoGamer.com said there was no reason to have it when better games like Mario Kart and Konami Krazy Racers (2001) were already available on the GBA. IGN, on the other hand, argued that the similarities to Mario Kart were not necessarily a bad thing as it allowed for balanced game design, and GameSpot called the game entertaining and favorably compared it to the original Super Mario Kart (1992). Eurogamer and VideoGamer.com also questioned how appealing the game would be to players, noting characters such as Banjo were relatively obscure and would likely only be recognised by those who played the N64 Banjo games.

To remedy the problem of the flooding, the Buttonwood Tunnel and three boreholes known as the South Wilkes-Barre Boreholes were created. The water quality of the creek was assessed in 1970 as part of Operation Scarlift. A 1977 study by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission observed brook trout inhabiting the watershed, although the stream was listed as impaired on account of the mining. A plan called the Solomon Creek Cold Water Conservation Plan was initiated in the summer of 2011 and continued into 2012. A mine fire known as the Laurel Run mine fire started burning in the watershed of Solomon Creek since 1915, when a miner accidentally left a carbide lamp hanging from a timber support in the Red Ash Coal Mine. The lamp caused the support to catch fire. The fire may continue into the 22nd century. The fire was contained in 1973, but was not extinguished.

The police units participated in the annexation of Austria and the occupation of Czechoslovakia. Police troops were first formed into battalion-sized formations for the 1939 invasion of Poland, where they were deployed for security and policing purposes, also taking part in executions and mass deportations.\n\nTwenty-three Order Police battalions were slated to take part in the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa. Nine were attached to security divisions of the Wehrmacht. Two battalions were assigned to support the Einsatzgruppen, the mobile death squads of the SS, and the Organisation Todt, the military construction group. Twelve were formed into regiments, three battalions each, and designated as Police Regiments Centre, North, South, and Special Purpose. The goals of the police battalions were to secure the rear by eliminating the remnants of the enemy forces, guarding the prisoners of war, and protecting the lines of communications and captured industrial facilities. Their instructions also included, as Daluege stated, the \"combat of criminal elements, above all political elements\".\n\nAlong with Police Battalions 307 and 316, Police Battalion 322 was assigned to Police Regiment Centre.

He brought news to General Carleton that the Americans were setting up a gun battery at Pointe-Lévis, on the south shore of the river, across from the city. This battery would command the city's harbor and shipping on the river. Chasson also told Carleton that people to the south of the city were prepared to rise up against the Americans.\n\nCarleton gave Chasson instructions to deliver to Louis Liénard de Beaujeu, the seigneur of the Isle-aux-Grues (Crane Island), an island in the Saint Lawrence, and a man with previous military experience in the French and Indian War. The instructions included intercepted communications from Arnold describing the difficult conditions in the siege camp and an amnesty for people who had previously supported the Americans but were now willing to assist the British. Beaujeu, who had previously been asked to raise militia in support of the British, set about raising a force to make an attack on the unfinished battery at Pointe-Lévis. By March 23, he had assembled over 100 men at Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pocatière. When this force reached Saint-Thomas on the night of March 24, it was joined there by an additional 70 men. An advance guard from this force, numbering 46, was sent to Saint-Pierre under the command of Couillard and Gaspé, where they established a base at the house of Michel Blais, a Loyalist and former commander of the local militia.\n\n ## Americans warned\n\nHabitants from Beaumont friendly to the Americans notified the commander at Pointe-Lévis of the recruiting activity. In response, General Arnold, sent a detachment of 80 Americans under John Dubois to deal with the situation. Pierre Ayotte and Clément Gosselin, recruiters working for Moses Hazen, the commander of the 2nd Canadian Regiment, raised about 150 men who joined the Americans. These forces headed up the southern shore to investigate the reports. Some of these recruits were from the same villages from which Beaujeu had recruited men. A small band of militia from Beaumont went to Saint-Michel and arrested Chasson, who was planning to return to the city.\n\n ## Conflict\n\nThe Loyalist advance guard was surprised by the arrival of the Patriot forces at Saint-Pierre, and barricaded themselves in the house, where they were attacked by Dubois' men with musket and cannon. While a few escaped, the majority surrendered, and three were killed. Their priest, Charles-François Bailly de Messein, was wounded in this battle. It is said that, because both sides recruited in the same areas to build their militias, that there were some families whose members fought against each other in this battle.\n\n ## Aftermath\n\nBeaujeu, his plans uncovered, disbanded the militia and went into hiding on Île-aux-Grues. After Dubois established that the action had been sanctioned by the British, some of the prisoners were released after promising not to take up arms again. The remaining 21 prisoners were sent to the American camp outside Quebec.\n\nThe skirmish itself had no notable effect on relations between the people and the occupying Americans, which were already deteriorating as the siege dragged on. This was due in part to the fact that the Americans, rather than paying for their supplies in coin, paid with Continental paper currency or promissory notes, deemed to be of little worth by the locals.\n\n ## See also\n\n- List of American Revolutionary War battles","prompt":"What was the name of the Loyalist who provided a base for the advance guard at Saint-Pierre during the Battle of Saint-Pierre?","answer":"Michel Blais","generation":"During the Battle of Saint-Pierre in 1776, the Loyalist who provided a base for the advance guard at Saint-Pierre was Louis Liénard de Beaujeu.

This was largely due to the gigantic increase in traffic on US 66 through Arizona over the last decade. A Flagstaff-based newspaper once stated that US 66 carried the largest number of interstate travelers of any highway in Arizona. By 1954, more than one million cars a year were traveling down US 66 from New Mexico to California. The increased traffic had also led to a greater number of car accidents and traffic jams, the latter of which earned US 66 the unfortunate reputation of being \"The World's Largest Traffic Jam\". By 1956, at least one out of six deaths resulting from car accidents in Arizona took place on US 66. This helped the highway earn another negative nickname, \"Bloody 66\". The rough shape, narrowness and safety issues along US 66 and similar highways in Arizona contributed to public sentiment towards rebuilding and improving safety along the state's highways. In 1954, President Dwight D.  Eisenhower heavily endorsed the long-standing idea of constructing a nationwide network of four-lane divided superhighways. Originally proposed back in the 1930s, this system of nationwide freeways would have entirely controlled access through the entry and exit ramps, as well as grade-separated interchanges with other highways, roads, and railroads. The new freeways would also include smoother grades coupled with more gradual curves. These massive changes in highway construction were intended to help increase traffic flow and greatly reduce car accidents occurring on the national highway network. Eisenhower pushed the United States Congress to accept the idea and appropriate funding for the new system. Congress finally approved the proposal with the passage of the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956, bringing into existence the Interstate and Defense Highway System. Several U.S. Highways in Arizona were chosen to become the corridors for the new Interstates, including US 66, which was slated to be replaced by I-40. By December 1960, approximately 15 miles (24 km) of US 66 had been rebuilt into the first section of I-40 to open in Arizona, and a further 23 miles (37 km) of US 66 was also undergoing conversion into I-40. By October 1962, 15.4 miles (24.8 km) of US 66 between Williams and Flagstaff was being rebuilt into parts of I-40.","prompt":"What negative nickname did U.S. Route 66 earn due to the high number of car accident fatalities in Arizona?","answer":"Bloody 66","generation":"U.S. Route 66 earned the negative nickname \"Bloody 66\" in Arizona due to the high number of car accident fatalities that occurred on that stretch of the highway.","run_id":"task_1_run_8","is_correct":true,"is_hallucinated":false}

Bodeen revised the script, basing the story on a Satanic society meeting he attended in New York City and setting it as a prequel to Cat People (1942), with Conway reprising his role as Dr. Louis Judd. Filming took place over 24 days in May 1943 at RKO Studios in Los Angeles.\n\nReleased on August 21, 1943, the film failed to garner significant income at the box office and received mixed reviews from critics, who found its narrative incoherence a primary fault. It was later revealed that Robson and editor John Lockert had removed four substantial scenes from the final cut, including an extended conclusion. In spite of its mixed reception, the film became a cult film in England, noted by critics for its homoerotic undertones.\n\n","prompt":"What was the location setting for the underground cult in the 1943 film \"The Seventh Victim\"?","answer":"Greenwich Village, New York City.","generation":"The underground cult in the 1943 film \"The Seventh Victim\" is set in Greenwich Village, New York City.","run_id":"task_1_run_8","is_correct":true,"is_hallucinated":false}

The same year, Cressey joined the faculty of Syracuse University as a professor of geography and geology, and soon became chairman of the department. After the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in September 1931, Cressey's travels in Asia made him a sought-after expert and lecturer on China, and he traveled frequently, giving lectures to academic audiences and the general public.

After his trip to Moscow, Cressey traveled widely in the Soviet Union, and after returning to the United States he spoke of the great economic potential of the country, despite anti-Soviet sentiment. As a result, he earned \"the trust and gratitude of his Soviet colleagues,\" allowing him access to their knowledge and resources.

They were told that they would be taken to Bjelovar for interrogation. Instead, they were ordered to march in the opposite direction, towards a field beside the river Plavnica where an open-air market was held each week. The prisoners left Gudovac just before sunset, supervised by as many as 70 armed guards. Many of the prisoners sensed the fate that awaited them but were unable to escape. According to one post-war testimony, Čikoš was \"upset, uneasy ... and in no mood to talk\". As the prisoners were being marched out of Gudovac, he pulled one of his Serb neighbours from the group and told him to \"get lost\" before ordering the remaining 200 detainees to line up against a wall. Kvaternik appeared before the group and asked if it contained any Croats. Four stepped forward and offered their identification papers; three were permitted to return to their homes upon having their identities verified but the fourth was sent back among the Serbs because he was a communist. Kvaternik, Čikoš and several newly appointed Ustaše officers supervised the march. According to survivors, the guards hurtled insults at the prisoners, and forced them to sing Ustaše songs and chant \"Long live Pavelić! Long live Kvaternik!\" The prisoners reached the field just after sunset and were ordered to line up in ranks and make a left face; the guards then raised their rifles and opened fire. Some executioners hesitated before firing, conscious that their friends and neighbours were about to be killed, and many of the victims were initially struck in the legs. Some of the wounded cursed the Ustaše and others cried in agony. Kvaternik observed the massacre from a distance of about 50 metres (160 ft), accompanied by Hans, Verhas and Pavlešić. Pavlešić was dissatisfied with the speed of the killings and shouted at Čikoš, telling him to \"finish the job\". Čikoš's men then went about looking for survivors and bayonetting anyone that moved. Five prisoners escaped before Čikoš's men could kill them and fled to a nearby forest. The killings were the first act of mass murder committed by the Ustaše upon coming to power. Estimates of the number of victims vary. Marko Attila Hoare, a historian specializing in the Balkans, puts the figure at 184 killed. The journalist Tim Judah writes that there were 187 fatalities.

Perone calls them \"thought-provoking,\" and \"clearly autobiographical.\" At this point in his career, Bowie was frequently being told how to musically progress by his managers and labels, leading him to experiment with genres such as folk, hard rock and soul. This is reflected in the first verse, in which the narrator looks at himself through a mirror to help find his true identity. Perone argues that the verse serves as a \"public acknowledgment\" that these earlier styles, all of which failed to earn him stardom, were not the \"true David Bowie style.\" Biographer Nicholas Pegg identifies the line \"I turned myself to face me\" as mirroring Bowie's encounter with himself in his 1970 track \"The Width of a Circle\". O'Leary writes that with \"Changes\", Bowie commits to a \"life of constant revision.\" By saying \"look out you rock 'n' rollers\", Bowie is \"throwing the gauntlet down to existing rockers\" and \"putting a distance between himself and the rock fraternity.\" Like \"Life on Mars?\", \"Changes\" was a response to Frank Sinatra's \"My Way\"; biographer David Buckley cites the line \"turn and face the strange\" as \"not a valedictory farewell, but a prophetic hello.\" According to Buckley, the phrase 'strange fascination' \"not only embodies a continued quest for the new and the bizarre but also carries with it the force of compulsion, the notion of having to change to stay afloat artistically.\" The first verse elucidates the three most important components in Bowie's quest for stardom: the themes of identity, the \"mutability\" of character\" and a \"sense of play\" in both first and third person, signaling the creation of Ziggy Stardust. Throughout the 1970s, Bowie had a \"pathological fear\" of repeating himself, both musically and visually. He gave himself the epithet 'faker' and proclaimed himself as \"pop's fraud; the arch-dissembler.\" Pegg states that his identification of himself as the 'faker' gives him anxiety, believing that he is \"much too fast\" to be affected by how others' opinion of him.","prompt":"What phrase does David Buckley cite from \"Changes\" as \"not a valedictory farewell, but a prophetic hello\"?","answer":"turn and face the strange","generation":"David Buckley cites the phrase \"And these children that you spit on\" from David Bowie's song \"Changes\" as \"not a valedictory farewell, but a prophetic hello.\"","run_id":"task_1_run_8","is_correct":false,"is_hallucinated":true}

These electrocytes are stacked in vertical columns, with many columns making up each electric organ; this arrangement functions essentially like batteries connected in parallel. The diet of the Japanese sleeper ray includes benthic invertebrates. A parasite of this species is the tapeworm Anteropora japonica (Yamaguti, 1934) Subhapradha, 1955.\n\nThe Japanese sleeper ray is viviparous, with the developing embryos nourished initially by yolk and later by histotroph (\"uterine milk\") produced by the mother. Females bear litters of up to five pups in early summer; the newborns measure 10 cm (3.9 in) long and are lighter and more uniform in color than the adults. Sexual maturity is reached at a length between 23–37 cm (9.1–14.6 in) for males, and at around 35 cm (14 in) for females.\n\n","prompt":"What is the primary diet of the Japanese sleeper ray?","answer":"Benthic invertebrates.","generation":"The Japanese sleeper ray (Narke japonica) primarily feeds on small fish and invertebrates.

A tropical wave that traversed Central America around June 11 may have contributed to the storm's formation as well. On June 12, the Miami-based National Hurricane Center (NHC) reported that a broad area of low pressure had formed several hundred miles south of southeastern Mexico. The NHC continued to monitor the disturbance over the next two days as it drifted northward. Initially, strong upper-level winds prevented development, but the system increased in organization unexpectedly on June 14. Following further structural improvements, the NHC upgraded the system to tropical depression status at 18:00 UTC while it was located about 140 mi (220 km) south of Acapulco. Around that time, the NHC forecast that a mid-level ridge over Mexico would weaken the following day, and would leave the depression in an area of light steering currents. Despite being located in a favorable environment with low to moderate wind shear and sea surface temperatures exceeding 86 °F (30 °C), the depression experienced minimal change in intensity over the next 18 hours. After the system's center reformed farther north, the NHC amended its intensity forecast to indicate reduced strengthening, citing the fact that the system would spend less time over water. Around 18:00 UTC on June 15, the system strengthened into a tropical storm, after which it was assigned the name Carlotta. The system's intensity then leveled off for about twelve hours. Early on June 16, Carlotta's forward motion began to fluctuate, changing from northeast to southeast in six hours. The storm began to intensify again around 06:00 UTC as it stalled off the coast of Mexico. Soon after, the cyclone began moving in a northerly direction. Over the next twelve hours, Carlotta experienced little change in organization before peaking at 00:00 UTC on June 17, with maximum sustained winds of 65 mph (100 km\/h) and a minimum central pressure of 997 mbar (29.44 inHg) while located only 30 mi (50 km) south-southeast of Acapulco. Around that time, the NHC noted that the system's structure had improved significantly, with a contracting eye and more symmetric eyewall. As the system started tracking towards the northwest, Carlotta began to weaken because of increasing interaction with land and northerly wind shear. Around 18:00 UTC on the June 17, the storm weakened into a tropical depression after lacking organized deep convection for several hours. Over the next day, the depression continued to weaken before degenerating into a remnant low on June 19 at 00:00 UTC. Shortly afterwards, Carlotta's upper-level circulation decoupled entirely and drifted towards the southwest, while the low- and mid-level remnants remained. The system's remnants dissipated around 06:00 UTC while located offshore of the Mexican coast between Manzanillo and Zihuatanejo, having never made landfall as a tropical cyclone.","prompt":"What was the peak sustained wind speed of Tropical Storm Carlotta (2018)?","answer":"65 mph (100 km\/h)","generation":"The peak sustained wind speed of Tropical Storm Carlotta in 2018 was 65 mph (100 km\/h).","run_id":"task_1_run_9","is_correct":true,"is_hallucinated":false}

Brummer was ready for service with the fleet by May 1916, though she did not steam with the rest of the High Seas Fleet for the Battle of Jutland at the end of the month. In the autumn of 1917, Admiral Reinhard Scheer, the chief of the Admiralstab, decided to supplement the U-boat campaign with surface raiders to attack the British convoys to Scandinavia. In addition to damaging British shipping, Scheer sought to divert escorts from the Atlantic theater, where his U-boats were concentrated. Brummer, commanded by Fregattenkapitän Leonhardi, and Bremse, commanded by Fregattenkapitän Westerkamp, were selected for the first such operation. Their high speed and large radius of action, coupled with their resemblance to British light cruisers, made them suited to the task. In preparation for the raid, their crews painted the ships dark gray to further camouflage them as British vessels. Half an hour after dawn on the morning of 17 October, Brummer and Bremse attacked a westbound convoy about 70 nautical miles (130 km; 81 mi) east of Lerwick. The convoy consisted of twelve merchantmen and was escorted by the destroyers HMS Strongbow and Mary Rose and a pair of armed trawlers. The German ruse worked, and the British destroyers initially thought they were friendly ships. They flashed recognition signals until the Germans opened fire at a range of 2,700 m (8,900 ft). Strongbow was quickly destroyed, and as Mary Rose rushed to engage, she too was sunk. The Germans then quickly sank nine of the merchant vessels; the two trawlers and three merchant ships managed to escape. The British Admiralty was not informed of the attack until Brummer and Bremse were on the return leg of the voyage.

At the end of every few levels, players fight a larger alien in a boss fight. Players score points by killing a large number of aliens in a short period of time, or by killing them in special ways, such as by using explosions or shooting them in the head. These points can be used to upgrade the player character, for example by boosting his resistance to damage or by increasing the amount of ammunition that he is able to carry. Players are able to carry two weapons at a time, and also have a pistol with unlimited ammunition. The player character can use both human- and alien-manufactured weapons in the game, and alien weapons use a cool-down period instead of having to reload. Weapons in the game include assault rifles, sniper rifles, shotguns, rocket launchers, and miniguns. The game is intentionally difficult; its easiest difficulty level is called \"challenging\", and the next easiest difficulty level is called \"hard\".\n\nThe game also offers competitive multiplayer. There are two modes – deathmatch and team deathmatch – and a small number of maps. Cooperative gameplay, which was mentioned in the game's initial announcement, did not make it into the final game.\n\n ### Plot\n\nAlien Rage takes place on an asteroid which humans and an alien species known as Vorus were jointly mining for Promethium, a highly efficient but extremely dangerous source of energy.

The first screenshots from the game were released two months later, in June 2012. In May 2013 the game's name was changed to Alien Rage, and two months later it was announced that the game would be released on the personal computer, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 on 24 September 2013.

Bowery started working on the game, titled \"spasim\" as a contraction of \"space simulation\", as a student in January 1974 while assisting professor Leif Brush with the first computer art class at the university. Brush showed Bowery and the class a PLATO graphics terminal in the Lindquist Center on campus, and Bowery, intrigued, signed up for an individual studies course to assist professor Bobby Brown, who ran the lab with this terminal. Bowery learned to program on the computer, helped by other users such as John Daleske, the developer of Empire (1973), and Charles Miller, who later made Moria (1975). Bowery was inspired by the multiplayer and graphical nature of Empire, a space action game, to create something in the same vein. Taking code for displaying a 3D vector graphics perspective previously written by Don Lee and Ron Resch, he designed 3D versions of the ships from Empire, and began adding more features to the game, including weapons inspired by Star Trek.\n\nThe first version of Spasim, subtitled \"An Investigation of Holographic Space\", was launched in March 1974. A few months later, Bowery set out to rewrite the game, with the assistance of metallurgy student Frank Canzolino. At first, the pair optimized the 3D graphics of the game, but Bowery, inspired by the concept of positive sum games, or cooperative games, decided to delete the entire game code from the mainframe and start over, building in strategy and resource management elements into the base game instead of adding them on top. Bowery designed the new version to penalize over-reliance on combat and incentivize cooperation as part of a philosophical stance on what he believed actual space expansion would require. The second version of Spasim was developed over the course of three days, and the pair released it in July 1974. Bowery released occasional updates to the game until he graduated; afterwards it was maintained by Steve Lionel, who added a tutorial on navigating in polar coordinates.\n\n","prompt":"Who developed the game Spasim?","answer":"Jim Bowery","generation":"The game Spasim was developed by Jim Bowery.

Critics praised the characters, themes, and story, but criticised plotholes, the main relationship, and the impact of players' decisions near the end of the game. Episode 1: Awake received mostly positive reviews from critics for the character development of Chloe Price and Rachel Amber. Jeremy Peeples of Hardcore Gamer found Chloe's behaviour \"endearing\" and noted that her personality was portrayed with multiple layers. Sam Loveridge at GamesRadar wrote that Rachel was the more authentic character because of her more \"grounded\" dialogue. Despite disparaging Chloe for being \"her same tiresomely combative self\" early on, Metro saw her fleshed out by enduring the loss of her father. Game Informer's Kimberley Wallace thought the younger version of Chloe brought a \"naivety and vulnerability\" worthy of sympathy. Conversely, the relationship between the leads was said to have formed \"at unnatural speed.\" Peeples and Loveridge favoured the \"Backtalk\" gameplay feature, while Metro and Wallace cared little for it. Reviewers found Episode 2: Brave New World to either be better than the first instalment or one of the series' greatest. Metro praised how choices made a difference with a \"profound effect\" on character arc, while Ozzie Mejia of Shacknews relished in Chloe's \"genuine growth\" contrasting her \"fiery spirit\". Game Informer's Joe Juba declared the continued comprehension of the character \"its biggest strength\". However, Juba's biggest complaint echoed Wallace's derision of the \"forced\" manner with which Chloe and Rachel become friends. Brett Makedonski, writing for Destructoid, thought the character exposition was done \"to great effect.\" Most noted was The Tempest school play sequence, which Metro said was their favorite, Mejia called \"one of the funniest\" in Before the Storm, and Juba observed as the culmination of all past choices. Metro criticised the script for being \"uneven\" and disapproved of the voice acting. Mejia felt the ending could have been done away with, saying it was \"a bit drawn out,\" though he was impressed with \"Backtalk\". Metro and Peeples agreed that Episode 3: Hell Is Empty was the most emotional of the season. The writing was lauded as authentic and genuine, with Wallace noting that it showed new sides to minor characters; conversely, Makedonski criticised that an ancillary character with little development became a primary antagonist. Although Metro observed some inconsistent dialogue and voice acting, Peeples said the cast showed \"incredible chemistry\". Wallace thought that Chloe and Rachel's \"tender moments\" were the best parts of the episode and Makedonski said \"their struggles, their mutual escapism, and their sacrifices\" provided more than enough investment. Reviewers generally approved of how the game concluded. ### Farewell\n\nThe Farewell DLC episode was described as aimed at fans and a great epilogue to the series by critics. The dialogue was lauded as melancholic and emotional. Reviewers noted the episode is ineffective for players who have not played the previous game and the short length of it. The return of the original voice actresses was also mentioned. Criticized were choices that are less pivotal and predicable writing.\n\n","prompt":"What gameplay feature did Peeples and Loveridge favor in \"Life Is Strange: Before the Storm\"?","answer":"Backtalk","generation":"In \"Life Is Strange: Before the Storm,\" writers Webb Peeples and Felice Kuan, along with lead writer Zak Garriss, particularly favored the introduction of the \"Backtalk\" mechanic.

This culture is known as Basketmaker III, and by 500 at least two such settlements had been established in Chaco Canyon. An important phase of Basketmaker III people is known as the La Plata. One of the earliest La Plata phase sites, Shabik'eshchee Village, was continuously occupied until the early 8th century, when the canyon was home to a few hundred people. Several clusters of Basketmaker III sites have been identified in the vicinity of Chetro Ketl. As the Basketmaker III people improved their farming techniques during the 8th century, the well-watered areas of the San Juan Basin became densely populated. Greater crop yields necessitated the construction of above-ground storage facilities, which were the first large-scale construction projects in the region. Fagan identifies this as the beginning of the first pueblos, \"ushering in a period of profound social tension, population movements, and political change.\" In his opinion, \"by 800, there was no going back. The people of Chaco and elsewhere were locked completely into economies based on maize and bean cultivation.\" Archeologists refer to the period starting c. 800 as the Pueblo I Period. By the early 10th century the large pit-house settlements had been supplanted by modular construction that later served as the foundation for the Ancestral Puebloan great houses. This marks the beginning of the Bonito Phase. During the 10th century, Chaco's population was swelled by a steady influx of immigrants from the San Juan River, approximately 100 miles (160 km) north. Fagan notes, \"Within a few centuries, as rainfall became more irregular and life less predictable, the Chacoans embarked on a cultural trajectory that melded ancient traditions with new ideas that were to crystalize into a brilliant and short-lived Southwestern society.\"","prompt":"What phase is identified with the transformation of Basketmaker II people into a society based on farming around Chaco Canyon?","answer":"Basketmaker III","generation":"The transformation of the Basketmaker II people into a society based on farming around Chaco Canyon is identified with the Basketmaker III phase.
