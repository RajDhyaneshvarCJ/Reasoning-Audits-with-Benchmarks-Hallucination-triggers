The spiracles behind its small eyes have raised, smooth rims. Its short and muscular tail bears a single dorsal fin positioned aft of the rounded pelvic fins, and terminates in a large caudal fin.\n\nInhabiting shallow, sandy areas near rocky reefs, the Japanese sleeper ray is a bottom-dwelling predator of invertebrates. Like other members of its family, it can produce a strong electric shock from its electric organs for defensive purposes. Females give live birth to litters of up to five pups. The gestating young are sustained at first by yolk, and later by histotroph (\"uterine milk\").

Braathens Rederi's first attempt at entering the helicopter market was in 1982, when it applied for a concession from the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications to operate offshore helicopters, which it was awarded in 1983. As a protest, the incumbent Helikopter Service applied for the airline routes that Braathens SAFE operated from Stavanger, but this application was rejected. The airline was not founded until 1 September 1989, after Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi, the owner of Braathens SAFE, made an agreement with the oil companies Phillips Petroleum, Norsk Hydro and Statoil. The agreement involved flights to the platforms Ekofisk, Oseberg, Gullfaks og Veslefrikk. Prior to this, Helikopter Service had held a monopoly on flights for the oil companies to their offshore installations. The oil companies wanted to establish a competitor to Helikopter Service to press down prices. The initial agreement gave a revenue of and gave the new company a 20% market share. Four 19-seat A\u00e9rospatiale Super Puma helicopters were ordered, each costing NOK 60 million. Total investment costs were NOK 300 million. Two helicopters were stationed at Stavanger Airport, Sola, and two at Bergen Airport, Flesland. Bjarne Sortland was appointed managing director. The first helicopter was delivered in May, with a new helicopter being delivered each month. They were named Havsulen, Havhesten, Hav\u00f8rn and Havsvale. Owner Bj\u00f8rn G. Braathen stated that his goal was that the airline would reach a 50% market share. In 1990, another challenger, M\u00f8refly, had also established themselves in the market. For the start of operations, Braathens Helikopter hired 22 pilots, most of them previously working for the Royal Norwegian Air Force. The company had 70 employees in total. Services started on 1 September 1990, where the initial contract involved flying 10,000 passengers per year. In January 1991, the company placed an order and an option for the Super Puma.

Thunderstorms increased and became more concentrated on June 8 after a tropical wave moved into the western Caribbean, and an upper-level low to its west increased outflow over the system. The disturbance moved slowly north-northwestward, and development was initially inhibited by marginally favorable upper-level winds and land interaction. The system gradually organized, and by June 10 a circulation formed with sufficiently organized convection for the National Hurricane Center to classify it Tropical Depression One. At this point the storm was located about 140 miles (230 km) south of the western tip of Cuba. The depression tracked to the northwest through the Yucat\u00e1n Channel into an area of increased wind shear, which left the center exposed and elongated. Despite its poor structure, the system maintained strong winds in its eastern semicircle. The depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alberto early on June 11 about 260 miles (420 km) southwest of the Dry Tortugas, based on Hurricane Hunters' reports of flight level winds of 50 mph (80 km\/h) in a few convective bands. Upon becoming a tropical storm, the low-level circulation had become better defined, though forecasts predicted the wind shear would increase, preventing significant strengthening of the storm. One forecaster at the National Hurricane Center remarked the system resembled a subtropical cyclone. However, deep convection developed and built westward against the wind shear as the overall organization improved. At the same time Alberto turned northeastward under the influence of an approaching trough. On June 12, the circulation abruptly reformed under the area of deepest convection, which coincided with the storm's passage over the loop current; consequentially, Alberto quickly strengthened to reach peak winds of 70 mph (110 km\/h) about 220 miles (350 km) west-northwest of Tampa, Florida. Though it was projected to track over cooler waters and stay in an area of increased shear, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predicted Alberto would attain hurricane status and make landfall at that intensity. The storm maintained peak intensity for about 18 hours, and while accelerating northeastward, Alberto's convection diminished as the cloud pattern became elongated. On June 13, dry air became entrained in the circulation, leaving the center exposed from the convection and the wind field greatly broadened.","prompt":"What was the peak wind speed of Tropical Storm Alberto (2006)?","answer":"70 mph (110 km\/h)","generation":"Tropical Storm Alberto (2006) reached its peak wind speed of 70 mph (110 km\/h)."}

Mallow had an overall length of 205 feet (62.5 m), a beam of 33 ft 2 in (10.11 m), and a draught of 13 ft 7 in (4.14 m) extending to 15 ft 9 in (4.8 m) at deep load. While her standard displacement was 925 long tons (940 t), she displaced 1,170 long tons (1,190 t) at deep load. She had a crew of 85 men. She was powered using steam created by two cylindrical boilers, driving a single 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engine that generated 2,750 indicated horsepower (2,050 kW). The engine drove a single propeller and Mallow could reach a top speed of 16 knots (30 km\/h; 18 mph).

The \\$1 million question was, \"Which of these U.S. Presidents appeared on the television series 'Laugh-In'?\", with the choices being A) Lyndon Johnson, B) Richard Nixon, C) Jimmy Carter, and D) Gerald Ford. Carpenter used his Phone-A-Friend lifeline to call his father not for help, but rather to inform him that he was going to win the million dollars.

With the Braves up five games in the NL standings and four games remaining on their regular season schedule, the Braves had a match-up with the Brooklyn Dodgers on September 29 but according to teammate Clint Conatser, Heath asked Braves manager Billy Southworth for the night off but his request was denied. During the game, Heath attempted to score from second base and slid towards home plate to try and beat the tag by Dodgers catcher Roy Campanella. As he slid, his foot got caught in the dirt which caused his ankle to twist. \"I began to slide about five feet from the plate. Funny thing, I generally get my spikes up off the ground, but this time I didn't.

These attacks coincided with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles on June 28, which eliminated any danger from Germany. Attempting to halt further hostilities, Marshal of France Ferdinand Foch proposed a new line, known as the Foch Line, on July 18, 1919.\n\nThe Foch Line was negotiated with the Polish war mission, led by General Tadeusz Jordan-Rozwadowski in Paris, while Lithuanian representatives were not invited. The Foch Line had two major modifications compared to the June 18 line: first, the entire line was moved west to give extra protection to the strategic Warsaw \u2013 Saint Petersburg Railway and second, the Suwa\u0142ki Region, including the towns of Sejny, Suwa\u0142ki, Pu\u0144sk, was assigned to Poland. Despite assurances at the time that the line was just a temporary measure to normalize the situation before full negotiations could take place, the southern Foch Line is the present-day Lithuania\u2013Poland border.\n\nOn July 26, the Foch Line was accepted by the Conference of Ambassadors as the provisional border between the two states. Lithuanians were not informed about this decision until August 3. Neither country was satisfied: both Lithuanian and Polish forces would have to retreat from the Suwa\u0142ki and Vilnius regions, respectively. Those Germans still present in the region also objected to the boundary of the line.

While the low-frequency radio required a complex ground installation and only a simple AM receiver on board the aircraft, NDB ground installations were simple single-antenna transmitters requiring somewhat more complex equipment on board the aircraft. The NDB's radio emission pattern was uniform in all directions in the horizontal plane. The NDB's on-board receiver was called a radio direction finder (RDF). The NDB-RDF combination allowed pilots to determine the direction of the NDB ground station relative to the direction the airplane was pointing. When used in conjunction with the on board magnetic compass, the pilot could navigate to or from the station along any chosen course radiating from the station.\n\nEarly RDF receivers were costly, bulky and difficult to operate, but the simpler and less expensive ground installation allowed the easy addition of NDB based waypoints and approaches, to supplement the low-frequency radio system. Modern RDF receivers, called \"automatic direction finders\" (or \"ADF\") are small, low cost and easy to operate. The NDB-ADF system remains today as a supplement and backup to the newer VOR and GPS navigation systems, although it is gradually being phased out. All questions regarding NDB\/ADF operation were removed from FAA pilot certification testing materials prior to October 2017.\n\n ## Limitations\n\nAlthough the low-frequency radio system was used for decades as the main aeronautical navigation method during low visibility and night flying, it had some well-known limitations and drawbacks. Pilots had to listen to the signals, often for hours, through the early generation headsets of the day. The course lines, which were a result of a balance between the radiation patterns from different transmitters, would fluctuate depending on weather conditions, vegetation or snow cover near the station, and even the airborne receiver's antenna angle. Under some conditions, the signals from the A quadrant would \"skip\" into the N quadrant (or vice versa), causing a false \"virtual course\" away from any real course line. Also, thunderstorms and other atmospheric disturbances would create electromagnetic interference to disrupt the range signals and produce crackling \"static\" in the pilots' headsets.\n\n","prompt":"What is the name of the receiver used on board aircraft to determine the direction of the NDB ground station?","answer":"radio direction finder (RDF)","generation":"The receiver used on board aircraft to determine the direction of a Non-Directional Beacon (NDB) ground station is called an Automatic Direction Finder (ADF).

Kahn accordingly made the building's exterior relatively undramatic, suitable for a small New England town. Its facade is primarily brick with teak wood panels at most windows marking the location of a pair of wooden carrels. The bricks are load-bearing; that is, the weight of the outer portion of the building is carried by the bricks themselves, not by a hidden steel frame. Kahn calls this fact to the viewer's attention by making the brick piers noticeably thicker at the bottom where they have more weight to bear. The windows are correspondingly wider toward the top where the piers are thinner. Kahn said, \"The weight of the brick makes it dance like a fairy above and groan below.\" The corners of the building are chamfered (cut off), allowing the viewers to see the outer parts of the building's structure, the outer \"doughnut.\" The Macmillan Encyclopedia of Architects says, \"Kahn sometimes perceived a building as enclosed by 'plate-walls,' and to give emphasis to this structural form, he interrupted the plates at the corner, leaving a gap between them. The Library at Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire (1967\u20131972) is a classic example\". Each of these four brick \"plate-walls,\" which house the library carrels, is 16 feet (4.9 m) deep. At the top of the exterior walls is a row of openings similar to the windows below except that these openings are above the roof and have no glass. Vincent Scully said that Kahn was drawn to architecture based on \"solid, almost primitive, masonry masses with voids in them without glass.\" The bottoms of these window-like openings are 6 feet (1.8 m) above the floor of an arcade that follows the perimeter of the top of building. Another arcade circles the building on the ground floor. Kahn disliked the idea of a building that was dominated by its entrance, so he concealed the main entrance to the library behind this arcade. His original design, however, called for landscaping with a paved forecourt that would have indicated the entrance without disrupting the symmetry of the facade. Architectural historian William Jordy said, \"Perverse as the hidden entrance may seem, it emphatically reinforces Kahn's statement that his design begins on the periphery with the circle of individual carrels, each with its separate window.\"","prompt":"What material is primarily used for the facade of the Phillips Exeter Academy Library?","answer":"Brick","generation":"The facade of the Phillips Exeter Academy Library, designed by architect Louis Kahn, is primarily constructed of brick.
