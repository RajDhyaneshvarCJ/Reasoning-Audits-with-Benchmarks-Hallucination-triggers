         "Jan Willem Spruyt (4 July 1826 – 8 September 1908), also known as Jan Willem Spruijt and Jan Willem Landskroon Spruijt (birthname), was a South African civil servant, lawyer and statesman of Dutch descent. Spruyt was government secretary (1856–1862) and several times acting state president of the Orange Free State, and state secretary of the South African Republic (1866–1869).\n\nSpruyt grew up in the Netherlands, studied law, but did not complete his studies, and worked as a schoolteacher, before coming to South Africa. Here he practised as law agent in private practice in both Boer republics. Soon after his arrival he was also quickly enrolled in the administration of the Orange Free State, and attained a powerful position as government secretary. In this capacity he stood in for state president M.W. Pretorius several times in the period 1860–1862. In the third quarter of the nineteenth century several many Afrikaner politicians and government officials served in both Boer republics. So did Spruyt, who finished his career as state secretary of the South African Republic.\n\n ## Biography\n\n",

         "## Service as a Q ship First Prize underwent a refit at Ponsharden, near Falmouth. This included the fitting of two 12-pounder guns, at the bow and stern respectively. The gun at the bow was screened within a collapsible deckhouse while that at the stern was mounted such that it could be raised from the hold. Two Lewis guns and a machinegun were also fitted. The vessel's mode of propulsion was added to, with twin 50-horsepower (37 kW) diesel motors, manufactured by Kelvin Diesels, being fitted and for communications, a radio transmitter and receiver, not typical for sailing vessels of the time, was installed. First Prize was formally commissioned into the Royal Navy on 25 April 1917, with a crew of 27, including its commander, Lieutenant William Sanders, a New Zealander serving in the Royal Naval Reserve. She departed for her first patrol the next day. In the evening of 30 April, near the Scillies in the Atlantic, First Prize was attacked by a U-boat, U-93 commanded by Edgar von Spiegel von und zu Peckelsheim. The Q ship was badly damaged by shellfire from the U-boat's deck guns. Sanders, having dispatched a panic party in a small boat thus giving the impression of a ship being abandoned, remained under cover with his men. Despite several of them being wounded, the crew remained hidden. After 20 minutes of shelling, First Prize appeared to be sinking. The U-boat approached her port quarter, whereupon Sanders ordered the White Ensign hoisted and First Prize opened fire. Within a few minutes the submarine had received severe damage to her conning tower, with several crew members blown into the water. After moving away, the U-boat disappeared from sight in mist, and was believed by the crew of First Prize to have been sunk. The panic party, still in its boat, collected three survivors, including her captain, and brought them back to First Prize. The damage to the ship was serious, and the German prisoners assisted in repairs as it made for the Irish coast and received a tow as it approached Kinsale. Despite its damage, U-93 managed to struggle back to Sylt nine days later. In the meantime, the damaged First Prize returned to her port of Milford Haven. The Admiralty had renamed her, and she was to now be known as HMS Prize.",

It travels within the Bienville National Forest and it ends at MS 35 in Lorena. The road was constructed around 1967 and was paved by 1968. The route was signed as MS 902 on state maps by 1998.\n\n## Route description\n\nAll of MS 902 is located in Smith County. In 2018, the Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) calculated 210 vehicles traveling on MS 902 north of County Road 32-A (CO 32-A) on average each day. The road is legally defined in Mississippi Code § 65-3-3, as both MS 902 and MS 35 Connector, but it is signed as MS 902. The route is maintained by MDOT as part of the Mississippi State Highway System.\n\nMS 902 starts at a three-way junction with MS 481 in the unincorporated area of Burns and travels northward. As the route is completely within the Bienville National Forest, the majority of the road is surrounded by forests, with several farms located along the way. It then intersects CO 502-A, a gravel spur route of CO 502, and CO 32-A, which travels to MS 35 near Lemon. MS 902 turns northeastwards south of CO 32-B, and continues in that direction until it ends at MS 35 in Lorena. The road continues as CO 32, which ends at CO 541 northwest of Klein.\n\n## History\n\nAround 1967, a gravel road from MS 481 to MS 35 was constructed within the Bienville National Forest in Smith County, and it was paved one year later. The road was signed as MS 902 on the state highway map by 1998.\n\n## Major intersections",

As soon as he is ordained he is to take charge of a church built for him by St. Elmo. Hammond, however, takes St. Elmo's friendship lightly and makes love to Agnes in secret. The affair is discovered by St. Elmo, who, in a rage at Hammond's perfidy, challenges him to a duel. The false friend loses his life in the ensuing combat. Edna, the granddaughter of the village blacksmith, strays upon the scene of the duel, an uninvited witness. St. Elmo is forced to flee the country. He is pursued by Agnes and the sheriff. Edna tells her first lie when she deceives St. Elmo's pursuers as to his direction and leads them completely off the trail. St. Elmo makes good his escape. On the day that Edna witnesses the duel her grandfather dies, leaving her alone in the world. She is adopted by St. Elmo's mother. Five years later the fugitive returns. Edna recognizes him as the victor of the dual but he does not remember having met her. He discovers that he loves the girl. Edna rejects his suit, declaring that she never would marry a man who had taken a human life. In desperation, St. Elmo attempts suicide, choosing as a spot the grave of Dick Hammond, but is swerved from his purpose by Edna, who relents and promises him her love and sympathy. St. Elmo decides that life is worth living if but for her sake.\"\n\n ## Cast\n\n- Frank H. Crane as St. Elmo\n- Anna Rosemond as Agnes\n- Gertrude Thanhouser\n- Carey L. Hastings\n\n",

The single featured illustrations by Brunetti, and was released as a digital download on December 4, 2012. Its accompanying music video was directed by Vincent Forcier, using concert footage from Tomahawk's 2012 concerts. Another music video was also made for the title track.\n\nOddfellows debuted at number sixteen on the UK Rock Chart album countdown on February 9, 2013, spending one week in the chart. In the United States, Oddfellows recorded positions in several of Billboard magazine's charts—reaching a peak position of 69 on the Billboard 200, 12 on the Alternative Albums listings, second place on the Hard Rock Albums chart, and ninth on the Independent Albums chart.

         "## Development and release\n\nMost of the developers at Paladin Studios had played games from Nintendo, and had been trying to do a collaboration for about ten years. Nintendo's producer, Takao Nakano, played some of the company's mobile games, and believed they put care into them. A team from Nintendo met with the company in 2017, and was interested in a prototype conceptualized by Paladin Studios. Paladin Studios wanted to make a game that was easily accessible to a broad audience; they wanted a game that could be enjoyed by children and adults, as well as one that had simple controls. They decided to set the game in an office setting, as it was easily recognizable and would allow players to use common objects in surprising ways. They liked the contrast of a mundane office setting with chaotic and destructive actions.\n\nNintendo and Paladin Studios discussed regularly and worked together on the game very closely, actively video chatting each other to collaborate. Paladin Studios, located in The Netherlands, would create a working prototype of the game and send it to Nintendo in Japan for review every day. Both countries have opposite time zones, so every morning Nintendo had a prototype they could review, and every morning Paladin Studios had a review back from Nintendo. Due to both companies being in different parts of the world, it helped further their intentions of being enjoyable by a larger group of players. Although both companies had similar ideas, they sometimes had conflicting opinions on the office setting, as certain parts of a typical building were different in the two countries.\n\nThe developers encountered multiple bugs during the game's creation, such as glitch where every object in the level would immediately be destroyed. One of the glitches, where a printer wrapped in a cable would cause it to be violently launched in all directions, inspired the creators to increase the launch speed of cables. Due to the game revolving around physics, play testers found it enjoyable to search for hidden bugs.\n\nThe game had a two-year development cycle, and was announced on March 26, 2020, releasing the same day. Nintendo only told Paladin Studios that the game would be featured in a Nintendo Direct shortly before the announcement, which caught the company by surprise. Paladin studios commented how \"Nintendo did a tremendous job at guiding us through this process and really helped us make the best content we could possibly make.\"\n\n",

Much of the precipitation fell during a fairly short time, and was beneficial, as the area had been suffering from severe drought conditions. In Pinar del Río province, the precipitation flooded 50 sq mi (130 km<sup>2</sup>) of crop land. The storm damaged about 50 houses across the country, about half of which in Havana.\n\nAlberto dropped light amounts of rainfall across Mexico, with a 24-hour total peaking at 4 inches (100 mm) in Peto, Yucatán.

His performances that season included a near-no-hitter that was lost in the ninth inning in a 5–2 victory over the Fond du Lac Panthers. Linde was also given the most valuable player award for a week in July after a pitching performance, also against Fond du Lac, in which he struck out 14 batters in a 5–0 shutout victory. He finished the season with 13 wins, eight losses, and a 2.91 ERA in 22 pitching appearances. After the season ended, the league folded temporarily, and Linde enlisted with the United States Army Air Forces to serve in World War II.\n\nAfter returning from military service, Linde joined the Greenville Spinners, the Chicago White Sox minor league affiliate of the Sally League. He tried out for the Milwaukee Brewers, but was unable to make the team, and as a result was sent to Greenville to gain experience. Linde pitched in 29 games for the Spinners. In those 29 games, he had ten wins, eight losses, a 3.50 ERA, and 121 innings pitched. After the conclusion of the season, in early November, Linde was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the rule 5 draft.\n\nThe following season, Linde pitched for the Oklahoma City Indians, the Indians minor league affiliate of the Texas League. He spent most of the season with Oklahoma City, and in a pitching appearance in August, threw a no-hitter and narrowly missed pitching a perfect game. In 32 appearances for Oklahoma City, Linde won 14 games, lost 13, and had an ERA of 2.85 in 202 innings pitched. At the end of the minor league season, Linde was called up to the Indians' major league roster along with Ernest Groth in order to build up the end of the bullpen.\n\n",

De Veuster and Other Priests Who Have Labored in the Leper Settlement of Kalawao, Molokaʻi''', his personal account of Father Damien's work on the island and a memoir of his own fifty-three year of experience living on Kalaupapa. It was discovered unpublished at the time of his death. Hutchison died on July 17, 1932, at the age of seventy-six, from an attack of influenza pneumonia. After his death, the unfinished manuscript was sent to the Sacred Hearts Archives in Leuven, Belgium for storage. Portions of the memoirs, an unfinished will and his other writings are stored at the Hawaii State Archives. According to historian Anwei Skinsnes Law, \"despite all his accomplishments and influence, Ambrose Hutchison had been largely left out of his own history.\"",

As in many places, a war memorial committee was formed to handle the town's commemorations and raise funds, beginning its work in January 1919. There were calls from within the community for a functional memorial, such as a meeting hall—which would be of benefit to the living—rather than a decorative monument. By May, the committee had decided to allocate a minority of its funds to a decorative memorial, the rest to be used for practical purposes such as grants for war widows and orphans. They chose Lutyens to design the monument, desiring an eminent architect. Lutyens' first proposal was for a cenotaph and he built a wooden model for public exhibition on the sea front. This was rejected by public opinion, as was his next proposal, for an obelisk. The successful design, for a statue and column, was agreed in March 1920. The committee's first choice of location was Palmeira Gardens but the landowner refused permission, leaving the committee with three sites on Grand Avenue. In June 1920, Lutyens visited Hove and chose a site in the middle of the road, near its northern end and parallel to the statue of Queen Victoria at the southern end. Lutyens designed dozens of war memorials across England, though Hove's was his only one in Sussex. Many war memorials were delayed by local disagreements or fundraising problems, but Hove's proceeded relatively smoothly once the design was agreed. The project was among the first of Lutyen's to be completed.\n\n",

However, hurricanes Gilma later that year, Ioke in 2006, and hurricanes Lane and Walaka in 2018 later reached lower barometric pressures in the Central Pacific. In addition, Emilia was the first Category 5 Pacific hurricane since Hurricane Ava in 1973. The fifth named storm and the first of three Category 5 hurricanes of the 1994 hurricane season, Emilia developed from an area of low pressure southeast of Hawaii on July 16. Tracking westward, the initial tropical depression intensified into a tropical storm several hours after tropical cyclogenesis. Subsequently, Emilia entered the Central Pacific Ocean and moved into the area of responsibility of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC).\n\nAfter reaching hurricane intensity the following day, the tropical cyclone began to rapidly intensify, and late on July 19, Emilia reached its record peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph (260 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 926 mbar (926 hPa; 27.3 inHg), rating it as a Category 5 hurricane. After slight oscillations in strength, an upper-level trough forced the intense hurricane northwest on July 21, and Emilia began to weaken thereafter. The tropical cyclone encountered an area of vertical wind shear and cool sea surface temperatures, which further weakened the system. The following day, Emilia made its closest approach to the Big Island of Hawaii, but subsequently weakened to below hurricane intensity. This weakening trend continued, and the tropical cyclone fully dissipated on July 25. Though the hurricane did not make landfall, Emilia brought strong surf to the islands of Hawaii and caused gusty winds, which resulted in some property damage. Precipitation was also reported, but remained under moderate levels.\n\n",

On Denver's first drive they drove 74 yards to a 2nd and goal at the Charger 6, before John Elway's pass was intercepted in the end zone by Glenn; he took off along the right sideline, slipped one tackle, benefitted from a block by Benson, and completed a 103-yard touchdown return, the joint-longest in league history at that point. Elway bounced back on his next two drives, a 51-yard completion setting up a touchdown run, and a 46-yard completion accounting for another touchdown. After an exchange of field goals, Fouts completed four passes for 58 yards, and the Chargers reached a 3rd and goal at the Denver 7 with 17 seconds left and no timeouts, trailing 17–10. Winslow caught Fouts' next pass inside the 1, but was ruled not to have broken the plane of the goal line before being pushed back by three Broncos. Time ran out before San Diego could attempt a field goal.\n\nDenver extended their lead on their first two drives of the second half via two further Elway touchdown passes. After the second of these, the Chargers responded; Anderson had catches of 38 and 33 yards, and Adams scored on a 1-yard run with 14 minutes to play. Denver's next drive ended with a missed field goal, but ran seven minutes off the clock. Fouts drove San Diego into opposition territory before his deep pass was intercepted to effectively clinch the game for Denver. He was intercepted again in the final minute.\n\nFouts completed 23 of 40 passes for 322 yards, with 2 interceptions. The Chargers were again dominated in terms of time of possession, holding the ball for only 18:41. They gave up a season-high 522 yards of offense.

         "A Song Flung Up to Heaven is the sixth book in author Maya Angelou's series of autobiographies. Set between 1965 and 1968, it begins where Angelou's previous book All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes ends, with Angelou's trip from Accra, Ghana, where she had lived for the past four years, back to the United States. Two \"calamitous events\" frame the beginning and end of the book—the assassinations of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. Angelou describes how she dealt with these events and the sweeping changes in both the country and in her personal life, and how she coped with her return home to the U.S. The book ends with Angelou at \"the threshold of her literary career\", writing the opening lines to her first autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.\n\nAs she had begun to do in Caged Bird, and continued throughout her series, Angelou upheld the long tradition of African-American autobiography. At the same time she made a deliberate attempt to challenge the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Most reviewers agreed that the book was made up of a series of vignettes. By the time Song was written in 2002, sixteen years after her previous autobiography, Angelou had experienced great fame and recognition as an author and poet. She recited her poem \"On the Pulse of Morning\" at the inauguration of President Bill Clinton in 1993, becoming the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since Robert Frost at John F. Kennedy's in 1961. She had become recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for Blacks and women. Angelou was, as scholar Joanne Braxton has stated, \"without a doubt, ... America's most visible black woman autobiographer\". She had also become, as reviewer Richard Long stated, \"a major autobiographical voice of the time\".\n\nThe title of Song was based upon the same poem, by African-American poet Paul Laurence Dunbar, the basis of her first autobiography. Like Angelou's other autobiographies, the book was greeted with both praise and disappointment, although reviews were generally positive. Reviewers praised Angelou for \"the culmination of a unique autobiographical achievement\", while others criticized her for coming across as \"smug\". The 2002 spoken word album by the same name, based on the book, received a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 2003.\n\n",

         "The Bugun liocichla (Liocichla bugunorum) is a passerine bird species from the family Leiothrichidae closely related to the Emei Shan liocichla. First spotted in 1995 in Arunachal Pradesh, India, it was described as a new species in 2006. The description was made without the collection of a type specimen as they were too few to risk killing one. It is thought to be an endangered species, with a small population, and a very restricted distribution range within which commercial development threatens the habitat.\n\n ## Description\n\nThe Bugun liocichla is a small babbler (20 cm (7.9 in)) with olive-grey plumage and a black cap. The face is marked with prominent orange-yellow lores, and the wings have yellow, red and white patches. The tail is black with crimson coloured undertail coverts and red tips. The feet are pink and the bill is black at the face fading to pale white. A second duller individual was mist netted, which was probably the female. The voice is described as fluty and distinctive.\n\nA study of the evolution of the species within the genus Liocichla based on mitochondrial DNA sequence similarity showed that the species is most closely related to L. omeiensis with the Hengduan Mountains possibly acting as the isolating barrier between the two.\n\n ## Distribution and habitat\n\nAll sightings of the species have been at an altitude of 2,000 m (6,600 ft) on disturbed hillsides covered with shrubs and small trees, with the exception of one sighting on the edge of primary forest. It lives in a territory similar to that of the Emei Shan liocichla. Small flocks were observed during January, whereas pairs were observed in May, with an estimated total of 14 individuals. It is thought that pairs may hold and defend territories. The Bugun liocichla is only currently known from just one location. Populations may be discovered in other areas of Arunachal Pradesh or neighbouring Bhutan.\n\nAttempts have been made to identify new locations where the species could occur based on identification of suitable habitats using computational models.\n\n",

         "## Taxonomy\n\nThe Madagascan sunset moth was first described by the British entomologist Dru Drury in 1773 from a specimen obtained from a Captain May of Hammersmith. Because of its resemblance to swallowtail butterflies, Drury described the species as Papilio rhipheus. The specimen Drury received had the head of a different species attached, probably that of a butterfly, which had clubbed antennae—this trait is frequently used to differentiate moths from butterflies. Once the inaccuracy in Drury's specimen was found, the moth was placed in the genus Urania, until 1823 when the German entomologist Jacob Hübner placed it in a new genus, Chrysiridia. The moth has also been described under other names. Because Drury described his specimen as having clubbed antennae and being tailless, William Swainson thought it was a different species than the complete specimen described by Pieter Cramer. In 1833, Swainson named the butterfly Rhipheus dasycephalus and the moth Leilus orientalis. Other synonyms include U. crameri by Maassen in 1879 and U. ripheus var. madagascariensis by Lesson in 1831.\n\nNative Malagasy people call it adriandolo or lolonandriana, from lolo for \"spirit\" or \"butterfly\" and andriana for \"noble\" or \"king\", therefore meaning \"noble butterfly\", \"noble spirit\", \"king butterfly\" or \"king spirit\".\n\nThe genus Chrysiridia is entirely African and the only other species in the genus is the East African C. croesus. Chrysiridia is one of three diurnal uraniine genera. The other two genera are Urania, its sister taxon, and Alcides, the most basal. In the group, the use of Endospermum is an ancestral state (a plesiomorphy). The more basal Alcides feed on Endospermum and Omphalea, while Urania and Chrysiridia feed only on Omphalea.\n\n",

Neurath, who Church said was \"very day to day at the beginning of the project\", became more involved with the company's business and finances. Church explained that the core of the project was its \"dynamic creation\". He noted that the team had \"no set of rules ... or pre-written plan\", but rather worked organically toward the general idea of creating a \"dungeon simulation\". Church believed that the game's Ultima series heritage was extremely helpful, as it gave the team an anchor for their experiments. According to Church, because the team was young and inexperienced, they were \"improvising almost the whole time\". He said that they would \"just write something\" that seemed interesting, but would then \"get it half done, and we'd say, 'Eh? That's not working.'\" He believed that this iterative method was useful overall, but that it entailed an abnormally large workload: it resulted in the creation of \"four movement systems before we were done, several combat systems, and so forth\". Certain failed experiments meant that the team created \"[AI] code for many ideas which turned out to be largely irrelevant to the actual gameplay\". During the first year of the game's development, Church believed that Origin had little faith in the team's ability to complete the game. He later said, \"They didn't pay any attention at all, frankly.\" While Origin CEO Richard Garriott helped the team in fitting the game into the Ultima franchise, Warren Spector later said that the company seemed \"blasé\" about Ultima Underworld \"for the first several months after ORIGIN and Blue Sky signed the deal\", despite his own belief that it was a \"change-the-world project\". Neurath opined that this was due to the team's status as outsiders, whose company was \"some 1,500 miles distant\" from their publisher. The team was advanced \\$30,000 to create the game, but its final cost was \\$400,000. The game was funded partly by Ned Lerner, and by Neurath's royalties from Space Rogue.

Quincy Jones served as the producer for both projects, in addition to working as the narrative writer for the audiobook. During the recording of the narration, Jackson became so upset when E.T. died that he wept. Jones and Spielberg both felt that trying to record the part again would not change the pop star's emotional reaction and decided to leave Jackson's crying in the finished recording. Jackson biographer Lisa D. Campbell wrote that Jones had learned this during the recording of \"She's Out of My Life\" (from the Off the Wall album), where the singer also broke down in tears.\n\nSeveral of the contributors to the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial storybook album had worked with Jackson on his solo projects in the past. Rod Temperton, who had written several songs featured on Off the Wall and Thriller, wrote the music for \"Someone in the Dark\". Freddy DeMann and Ron Weisner, former managers of The Jacksons, served as the production coordinators for the album. Bruce Swedien engineered E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, a task he had performed on Off the Wall and Thriller and would go on to perform for the next albums of Jackson. Dick Zimmerman photographed Jackson for the Thriller album cover, before again capturing the singer for the accompanying poster to the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial album.\n\nOnce the recording and engineering aspects of production had been completed, MCA Records (the distributor of the album) pressed more than a million copies of the audiobook. In 1982 a journalist for Billboard wrote that it was one of the \"most ambitious\" projects MCA Records had taken on to date.\n\n ## Jackson's empathy with the E.T. character\n\nJackson commented the following:\n\n> \"He's in a strange place and wants to be accepted – which is a situation that I have found myself in many times when travelling from city to city all over the world. He's most comfortable with children, and I have a great love for kids. He gives love and wants love in return, which is me. And he has that super power which lets him lift off and fly whenever he wants to get away from things on Earth, and I can identify with that. He and I are alike in many ways.\"\n\n",

         "For human use, tubes range in size from 2 to 10.5 mm (0.1 to 0.4 in) in internal diameter. The size is chosen based on the patient's body size, with the smaller sizes being used for infants and children. Most endotracheal tubes have an inflatable cuff to seal the tracheobronchial tree against leakage of respiratory gases and pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents, blood, secretions, and other fluids. Uncuffed tubes are also available, though their use is limited mostly to children (in small children, the cricoid cartilage is the narrowest portion of the airway and usually provides an adequate seal for mechanical ventilation). In addition to cuffed or uncuffed, preformed endotracheal tubes are also available. The oral and nasal RAE tubes (named after the inventors Ring, Adair and Elwyn) are the most widely used of the preformed tubes. There are a number of different types of double-lumen endo-bronchial tubes that have endobronchial as well as endotracheal channels (Carlens, White and Robertshaw tubes). These tubes are typically coaxial, with two separate channels and two separate openings. They incorporate an endotracheal lumen which terminates in the trachea and an endobronchial lumen, the distal tip of which is positioned 1–2 cm into the right or left mainstem bronchus. There is also the Univent tube, which has a single tracheal lumen and an integrated endobronchial blocker. These tubes enable one to ventilate both lungs, or either lung independently. Single-lung ventilation (allowing the lung on the operative side to collapse) can be useful during thoracic surgery, as it can facilitate the surgeon's view and access to other relevant structures within the thoracic cavity. The \"armored\" endotracheal tubes are cuffed, wire-reinforced silicone rubber tubes. They are much more flexible than polyvinyl chloride tubes, yet they are difficult to compress or kink. This can make them useful for situations in which the trachea is anticipated to remain intubated for a prolonged duration, or if the neck is to remain flexed during surgery. Most armored tubes have a Magill curve, but preformed armored RAE tubes are also available. Another type of endotracheal tube has four small openings just above the inflatable cuff, which can be used for suction of the trachea or administration of intratracheal medications if necessary. Other tubes (such as the Bivona Fome-Cuf tube) are designed specifically for use in laser surgery in and around the airway.",

They are available in both oral and nasal versions.\n\n2. **Preformed Nasal Tubes:** These tubes are specifically shaped to fit more comfortably and securely when inserted nasally. Their design helps ensure a stable position and reduces the likelihood of kinking.\n\n3. **Preformed Oral Tubes:** These are generally used in oral intubations and have a curve intended to help secure the airway while minimizing the risk of damage to surrounding tissues.\n\n4. **Microcuff Tubes:** These are used in pediatric care and have a thin, high-volume, low-pressure cuff to minimize pressure on the tracheal wall while still providing an effective seal.\n\nManufacturers such as Mallinckrodt, Teleflex, and others offer various models of preformed",

The reformed band rehearsed in Stowe, Vermont and recorded the album Perfect Strangers which was followed by a highly successful world tour. Another studio album with this formation, The House of Blue Light followed in 1987 but Gillan was concerned with the final results, stating \"There's something missing in the overall album. I can't feel the spirit of the band.\" This was followed by the live album Nobody's Perfect in 1988. The live album also featured a studio re-recording of the 1968 hit \"Hush\" with Gillan on vocals, to commemorate Deep Purple's 20th anniversary. (The original 1968 release had been sung by Rod Evans). Gillan later remarked that the album was \"the embodiment of all the things wrong with Purple.\" In contrast to his experiences with Deep Purple in the 1970s, Gillan felt frustrated that the band were no longer working enough. To fulfill his contract with Virgin, he formed a side project with Glover, writing and recording songs which didn't fit Purple's established hard rock style, which resulted in the album Accidentally on Purpose. By 1989, tensions between Gillan and Blackmore had resurfaced, due to the former's greater enthusiasm for touring and differences over the music – the song \"Mitzi Dupree\" on The House of Blue Light is the original demo as Blackmore refused to re-record it. This culminated in Blackmore calling a rehearsal session without Gillan. After an acrimonious argument Glover told Gillan, \"Ian you've gone too far this time,\" and he was fired. Gillan, meanwhile, formed a new version of Garth Rockett and the Moonshiners with keyboardist Mark Buckle, bassist Keith Mulholland, drummer Louis Rosenthal and guitarists Harry Shaw and Steve Morris. The band toured regularly through 1989, and recorded the album Naked Thunder. Gillan later expressed dissatisfaction with the album, calling it \"rather hum-de-dum\".",

Starr's album – composed of renditions of pre-rock standards that included musical arrangements by Quincy Jones, Maurice Gibb, George Martin and McCartney – peaked at number seven in the UK and number 22 in the US. Starr followed Sentimental Journey with the country-inspired Beaucoups of Blues, engineered by Scotty Moore and featuring renowned Nashville session musician Pete Drake. Despite favourable reviews, the album was a commercial failure. Starr subsequently combined his musical activities with developing a career as a film actor. Starr played drums on Lennon's John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970), Ono's Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band (1970), and on Harrison's albums All Things Must Pass (1970), Living in the Material World (1973) and Dark Horse (1974). In 1971, Starr participated in the Concert for Bangladesh, organised by Harrison, and with him co-wrote the hit single \"It Don't Come Easy\", which reached number four in both the US and the UK. The following year he released his most successful UK hit, \"Back Off Boogaloo\" (again produced and co-written by Harrison), which peaked at number two (US number nine). Having become friends with the English singer Marc Bolan, Starr made his directorial debut with the 1972 T. Rex documentary Born to Boogie. In 1973 and 1974, Starr had two number one hits in the US: \"Photograph\", a UK number eight hit co-written with Harrison, and \"You're Sixteen\", written by the Sherman Brothers. Starr's third million-selling single in the US, \"You're Sixteen\" was released in the UK in February 1974 where it peaked at number four. Both tracks appeared on Starr's debut rock album, Ringo, produced by Richard Perry and featuring further contributions from Harrison as well as a song each from Lennon and McCartney.

         "Smilodon is a genus of the extinct machairodont subfamily of the felids. It is one of the best known saber-toothed predators and one of the most famous prehistoric mammals. Although commonly known as the saber-toothed tiger, it was not closely related to the tiger or other modern cats. Smilodon lived in the Americas during the Pleistocene epoch (2.5 mya – 10,000 years ago). The genus was named in 1842 based on fossils from Brazil; the generic name means \"scalpel\" or \"two-edged knife\" combined with \"tooth\". Three species are recognized today: S.gracilis, S.fatalis, and S.populator. The two latter species were probably descended from S.gracilis, which itself probably evolved from Megantereon. The hundreds of specimens obtained from the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles constitute the largest collection of Smilodon fossils. Overall, Smilodon was more robustly built than any extant cat, with particularly well-developed forelimbs and exceptionally long upper canine teeth. Its jaw had a bigger gape than that of modern cats, and its upper canines were slender and fragile, being adapted for precision killing. S.gracilis was the smallest species at 55 to 100 kg (120 to 220 lb) in weight. S.fatalis had a weight of 160 to 280 kg (350 to 620 lb) and height of 100 cm (39 in). Both of these species are mainly known from North America, but remains from South America have also been attributed to them. S.populator from South America was the largest species, at 220 to 436 kg (485 to 961 lb) in weight and 120 cm (47 in) in height, and was among the largest known felids. The coat pattern of Smilodon is unknown, but it has been artistically restored with plain or spotted patterns. In North America, Smilodon hunted large herbivores such as bison and camels, and it remained successful even when encountering new prey species in South America. Smilodon is thought to have killed its prey by holding it still with its forelimbs and biting it, but it is unclear in what manner the bite itself was delivered. Scientists debate whether Smilodon had a social or a solitary lifestyle; analysis of modern predator behavior as well as of Smilodon's fossil remains could be construed to lend support to either view. Smilodon probably lived in closed habitats such as forests and bush, which would have provided cover for ambushing prey. Smilodon died out at the same time that most North and South American megafauna disappeared, about 10,000 years ago. Its reliance on large animals has been proposed as the cause of its extinction, along with climate change and competition with other species, but the exact cause is unknown.",

Additionally, Frazee still owed Lannin as much as \\$125,000 from the purchase of the club. Although Ruppert and his co-owner, Colonel Tillinghast Huston, were both wealthy, and had aggressively purchased and traded for players in 1918 and 1919 to build a winning team, Ruppert faced losses in his brewing interests as Prohibition was implemented, and if their team left the Polo Grounds, where the Yankees were the tenants of the New York Giants, building a stadium in New York would be expensive. Nevertheless, when Frazee, who moved in the same social circles as Huston, hinted to the colonel that Ruth was available for the right price, the Yankees owners quickly pursued the purchase. Frazee sold the rights to Babe Ruth for \\$100,000, the largest sum ever paid for a baseball player. The deal also involved a \\$350,000 loan from Ruppert to Frazee, secured by a mortgage on Fenway Park. Once it was agreed, Frazee informed Barrow, who, stunned, told the owner that he was getting the worse end of the bargain. Cynics have suggested that Barrow may have played a larger role in the Ruth sale, as less than a year after, he became the Yankee general manager, and in the following years made a number of purchases of Red Sox players from Frazee. The \\$100,000 price included \\$25,000 in cash, and notes for the same amount due November 1 in 1920, 1921, and 1922; Ruppert and Huston assisted Frazee in selling the notes to banks for immediate cash. The transaction was contingent on Ruth signing a new contract, which was quickly accomplished—Ruth agreed to fulfill the remaining two years on his contract, but was given a \\$20,000 bonus, payable over two seasons. The deal was announced on January 6, 1920. Reaction in Boston was mixed: some fans were embittered at the loss of Ruth; others conceded that Ruth had become difficult to deal with.",

         "## Publication history and contents Shortly before the start of World War II, two science fiction (sf) pulp magazines were launched in Britain: Tales of Wonder, which appeared in 1937, and Fantasy, which published its first issue the following year. Fantasy was forced to close down in 1939 as the war approached: the editor, T. Stanhope Sprigg, had enlisted in the RAF, and it was clear to the publisher, George Newnes Ltd, that paper rationing would soon be implemented. Tales of Wonder, published by The World's Work, was edited by Walter Gillings, who had been active in science fiction fandom since the early 1930s. Gillings was able to keep Tales of Wonder going until 1942, despite the paper shortages; even after he was drafted he was able to edit it for a while from his army camp, but the Spring 1942 issue was the last one. By 1943 Gillings was planning a new magazine, to be published by Temple Bar. He started collecting material for it, requesting stories that showed originality and focused on \"how technological advances might affect individuals rather than whole populations\", in the words of sf historian Mike Ashley. Paper rationing was still a concern, and Temple Bar were not convinced there was a sufficient market for sf, so they kept delaying the launch. Gillings's initial request for submissions was not fruitful, but by 1946 he had acquired enough material for nine issues. This included several stories by Arthur C. Clarke, though he returned some of them to Clarke as the publication delays lengthened, suggesting Clarke try them in the American market. Two of the stories, \"Loophole\", and \"Rescue Party\", appeared in Astounding Science Fiction in the April and May 1946 issues; these were Clarke's first professional fiction sales. Temple Bar finally took the plunge in 1946, convinced by the success of New Worlds, another British sf magazine, which had been launched that summer. The first issue, in digest format, was dated December 1946. The title was Fantasy, though there was no connection to Newnes' pre-war pulp magazine of that name; it was subtitled \"The Magazine of Science Fiction\". The lead story was \"Last Conflict\", by John Russell Fearn, and the issue also included a reprint of \"The Worlds of If\", a story by Stanley Weinbaum, and Clarke's \"Technical Error\"—his first sale to a British market.",

         "Gyroporus cyanescens, commonly known as the bluing bolete or the cornflower bolete, is a species of bolete fungus in the family Gyroporaceae. First described from France in 1788, the species is found in Asia, Australia, Europe, and eastern North America, where it grows on the ground in coniferous and mixed forests.\n\nThe yellowish to buff cap surface is fibrous and roughened, and reaches up to 12 cm (4.7 in) in diameter. The thick stem, roughly the same color as the cap or lighter, is hollowed out into chambers. All parts of the mushroom turn an intense blue color within a few moments of bruising or cutting. The mushroom is edible, despite its hard stem. A less common variety occurs where the color change is to deep violet rather than blue. The bluing reaction results from the oxidation of a chemical called gyrocyanin.\n\n ## Taxonomy\n\nThe species was first described scientifically by French botanist Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard in his 1788 Herbier de la France. Later synonyms include Boletus constrictus by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1801, Leccinum constrictum by Samuel Frederick Gray in 1821, Suillus cyanescens by Petter Karsten in 1882, and Leucoconius cyanescens by Günther Beck von Mannagetta und Lerchenau in 1923. The variety violaceotinctus was described by Roy Watling in 1969 from collections made in Michigan, USA.\n\nThe specific epithet is derived from the Ancient Greek κύανoς, meaning \"dark blue\", while the varietal epithet violaceotinctus means \"having a violet tinge\". It is commonly known as the bluing bolete or the cornflower bolete.\n\n",
         "What is the chemical responsible for the bluing reaction in Gyroporus cyanescens?",
         "gyrocyanin",
         "The bluing reaction in Gyroporus cyanescens, as well as in other blue-staining mushrooms, is primarily due to the oxidation of specific compounds called variegatic acid and gyroporin. When the flesh of the mushroom is damaged, these compounds are exposed to oxygen, leading to an enzymatic oxidative reaction that results in the production of blue-colored compounds, such as quinones. This reaction is facilitated by enzymes like polyphenol oxidase, which accelerates the oxidation process.",

All 30 tonnes (33 tons) of liquid steel, at a temperature of approximately 1,500 degrees Celsius (2,730 F), were spilled. This liquid steel then burst through the windows and door of an adjoining room 5 metres away where workers had gathered during a change of shifts, engulfing that room entirely.\n\nWhen emergency services arrived, they were initially unable to provide assistance as the high temperature of the molten steel prevented them from entering the area. When they were able to access the area, they discovered 32 workers had been killed by the spill. Six others in the room survived and were rushed to the hospital with severe burns. According to doctors, five workers were initially listed as being in a stable condition, whereas others were listed as critical. They were said to be at risk of contracting infections through their burns. However, an earlier statement on the website of the State Administration of Work Safety published conflicting information, saying that the 32 deceased represented everyone in the room at the time, and that only two people were injured – the operators of the ladle. The official Xinhua press agency also released a report stating that the ladle fell on workers below, but this was unclear as in to whether the workers were in fact crushed or whether this, too, conflicted with the other reports.\n\nAfter retrieving the six survivors, rescuers then recovered the bodies of the 32 deceased.\n\n",

         "## Historiography In 1913 the Bibliothèque nationale de France published a bibliography of its Collection de l'Enfer—the French equivalent of the Private Case. The move induced the lawyer and writer E. S. P. Haynes to produce \"The Taboos of the British Museum Library\", an essay in the literary magazine The English Review. Describing the existence of the Private Case as \"unsatisfactory\", he criticised the museum for censorship and wrote that \"the reputation of our National Library is suffering in consequence\" of the segregation of books. The library practice of keeping the names of Private Case books off the general catalogue he thought \"a ruinous policy, and one which in the long run may prove suicidal. Students will tend to go elsewhere\". He also stated that by censoring the existence of works in its holdings, the library \"is placing itself in a most dubious position\". Despite Haynes's essay the wider public continued to be unaware of the existence of the Private Case until the 1960s and it was only in 1962 that the library acknowledged that it held a collection of books not included in the main general catalogue. The situation of the segregated books was not discussed more widely until 1963 when there was a debate in the correspondence pages of The Times Literary Supplement about the library's policy. One of those involved in the correspondence was Peter Fryer, who went on to publish Private Case—Public Scandal: Secrets of the British Museum Revealed in 1966; the book was part of what Harris calls Fryer's \"courteous but persistent campaign on the subject\". Kearney catalogued the Private Case collection and published The Private Case: An Annotated Bibliography of the Private Case Erotica Collection in the British (Museum) Library in 1981, following seven years of research. It contains 1,920 items, although the material contains flaws. The historian A. S. G. Edwards, in an article for The Book Collector, calls the bibliography \"of very limited usefulness\", given that the book only details the works that were in the Private Case at the time of Kearney's research, and not the many items that had previously been in the case but had since been reclassified. Edwards also highlights flaws in attribution of some publications to anonymously produced books; in this way, Edwards says, it is \"very hard for the user of this work to be sure of the dividing line between hard fact and authorial conjecture\".",

The story begins during the second year of an illegal mining operation on the planet Aegis VII funded by the Unitology religious movement. The colonists discover a monolith-like artifact on Aegis VII they identify as a Marker, an object sacred to the Unitologists' beliefs. In reality, the Marker is a copy of an alien object that begins to have a fatal influence over the colony; this culminates in the colony's destruction by reanimated mutated corpses referred to outside the comic as \"Necromorphs\". The comic opens with a video log from Sergeant Abraham Neumann of the colony's P-SEC security, advising anyone still alive to nuke the planet. The story then jumps back five weeks to shortly after the Marker's discovery. While the colony was previously stable, the Marker's discovery prompts a wave of unusual incidents; beginning first as prevalent insomnia and hallucinations, many colonists then display symptoms of paranoia and become murderously violent. One of the colonists attacks medical officer Tom Sciarello, killing his assistant in the process. The Unitologists in the colony exacerbate the situation, as they attempt to worship at the Marker site. One of their number is Neumann's P-SEC partner Vera Cortez, and her beliefs and gradual decline drive a wedge between them. Marla Janssen, another P-SEC officer, becomes fascinated by symbols on the Marker seen on a leaked video. The colony leader Hanford Carthusia is given orders from the Unitology Church to safeguard the Marker until their ship, the Ishimura arrives. Between its discovery and the Ishimura's arrival, the situation deteriorates further; Sciarello treats a growing and increasingly severe outbreak of hysteria and paranoia on the colony, technician Cameron finds an unusual organic matter growing in the vent system, and one of the Marker security team Natalia Deshyanov kills a crewmember and suffers a complete breakdown. Carthusia, under orders from the Church, refuses to act and instead brings the Marker into the colony preparatory to sending both it and the colony's recent dead to the Ishimura.

It was originally released on April 23, 1990, in broadcast syndication. It was written by Dennis Putman Bailey and David Bischoff with uncredited work by Lisa Putman White. It was based on Bailey and Bichoff's 1976 short story, and subsequent 1979 novel, Tin Woodman. Both the short story/novel and the episode are named for the Tin Woodman from L. Frank Baum's Oz books.\n\nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, telepath Tam Elbrun (Harry Groener) joins the crew to investigate a bio ship detected near a star about to go supernova. As the crew investigates, the Romulans threaten the Enterprise and the creature, Gomtuu, and Elbrun boards it with Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner). As the star is about to explode, Gomtuu sends Data back to the Enterprise and the two ships out of the system. Gomtuu and Elbrun leave together as the star goes supernova.\n\nThe spec script was chosen as the crew believed it could go into production quickly. After purchasing it, the production of this episode began a week later. Groener guest starred as Elbrun, the first male Betazoid seen on the show. Michael Cavanaugh appeared as Captain Robert DeSoto, a character that was mentioned in \"Encounter at Farpoint\" and later in the franchise. The design of Gomtuu was based on an element from The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension, while the chair creation special effect was made using reverse motion. \"Tin Man\" received Nielsen ratings of 10.2 percent.

South of the Ann Street interchange, the highway crosses a line of the Grand Rapids Eastern Railroad. After crossing both the railroad and Ann Street, the highway widens to allow for a grassy median. The freeway leaves Grand Rapids and enters Walker north of Ann Street.\n\nApproaching I-96 from the south, the freeway passes east of the former DeltaPlex Arena, and the median widens further across the river from Comstock Riverside Park in Walker.

         "Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Revelation, known in Europe as Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Reverie, is a role-playing video game developed by Heartbeat and published by Enix for the Super Famicom as a part of the Dragon Quest series and as the last Dragon Quest game in the Zenithian Trilogy. It was released in Japan in December 1995, developed by Heartbeat; whereas the previous Dragon Quest games were developed by Chunsoft. In 2011, a remake of the game, along with Dragon Quest IV and Dragon Quest V, was released worldwide for the Nintendo DS, making this the first time the game was released in English. Another version of the game for Android and iOS devices was released in Japan in June 2015.\n\nAs the sixth installment to the Dragon Quest series, the graphics and gameplay remain close to the other games, with minor additions and upgrades. The graphics were vastly improved from Dragon Quest V, which was also for the Super Famicom, but had more rudimentary graphics due to being an early game on the console. Navigation remains largely unchanged from the previous games and the turn-based battles are still in first-person. The class system from Dragon Quest III returns, with minor adjustments. Dragon Quest VI sold over three million copies in Japan, becoming the best selling game of 1995. The DS version sold an additional one million copies by March 2010.\n\nThe story follows the traditional Dragon Quest \"Hero\" on a quest to save the world. In this particular installment, the heroes also have to endure the personal struggle of amnesia, as many of the main characters do not initially remember who they are. After completing a series of quests, the player learns that in addition to a Real World, there is also a Dream World, made up of people's dreams, and that there is a great evil that wants to conquer both. The Hero and his new party work together to save both worlds from the ever-growing threat.\n\n",

Upon her arrival, Peresvet became the flagship of the squadron's second-in-command, Rear Admiral Prince Pavel Ukhtomsky. During the Battle of Port Arthur (February 1904) on the second day of the war, Peresvet was not hit, but Pobeda was hit once amidships, sustaining little damage but losing two men killed and four wounded. Pobeda struck a mine during the squadron's sortie on 13 April and remained under repair for almost two months. Both ships had some of their anti-torpedoboat guns and secondary armament removed during the summer to bolster the defenses of the port. They participated in the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August 1904; Pobeda was only lightly damaged by 11 large-caliber hits, but Peresvet, hit 39 times, suffered a considerable amount of flooding. More guns were landed after the squadron's return to Port Arthur, but the Imperial Japanese Army captured the hills overlooking the harbor in November, and this allowed Japanese 28-centimeter (11 in) siege guns to fire directly at the Russian ships. Pobeda and Peresvet were hit many times, and Pobeda sank on 7 December 1904 from the accumulated damage. Peresvet was scuttled in shallow water on the same day. Construction of Oslyabya, named after Radion Oslyabya (another monk who had fought at the Battle of Kulikovo), was greatly delayed, and the ship found herself en route to the Far East when the Russo-Japanese War began in February 1904. She was ordered home and assigned to the Second Pacific Squadron that was intended to relieve the forces in Port Arthur. The ship served as the flagship of Rear Admiral Baron Dmitry von Fölkersam, second-in-command of the squadron, but he died two days before the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905. Oslyabya led the Second Division of the squadron during the battle and was the target of numerous Japanese ships during the early part of the battle. Many of the hits on the ship were along the waterline and caused extensive flooding. Efforts to counteract the resulting list destroyed her remaining stability and she sank just over an hour after the Japanese opened fire—the first modern battleship to be sunk solely by gunfire. Sources differ on the exact number of casualties, but the lowest figure given is 471.",

During the war, it was involved in several engagements but was eventually trapped in the harbor at Port Arthur along with the rest of the Russian fleet.\n\nIn December 1904, after a prolonged siege, Port Arthur fell to the Japanese. The Pobeda was scuttled by its crew to prevent it from being captured intact. However, the Japanese were able to raise and salvage the ship. They repaired and recommissioned it into the Imperial Japanese Navy as the Suwo. The ship served as a training vessel and later as a coastal defense ship until being decommissioned and scrapped several years later.",

         "### Nitehawk Prospect Park\n\nIn September 2016, Nitehawk announced plans to open a second location, Nitehawk Prospect Park, in Park Slope. It is located in an historic Art Deco movie theater adjacent to Prospect Park that operated as the Sanders Theater from 1928 to 1978, and as the Pavilion Theater from 1996 to 2016. Viragh and the building's owner had discussed converting the theater into a Nitehawk in 2011, but discussions fell through following the opening of Nitehawk Williamsburg. In 2015, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission approved a plan that would have partially converted the building into condominiums and shrunk the floor area of the theater. However, an investment firm ultimately purchased the building for \\$28 million and granted a long-term lease to Nitehawk.\n\nNitehawk Prospect Park underwent renovations through 2016 and 2017, at a cost of \"less than \\$10 million\". Originally slated to open in fall 2017, renovation delays and the discovery of historic elements from the Sanders theater amid demolition led the opening to be postponed, and it ultimately reopened on December 19, 2018. The theater, which includes seven screens, 650 seats, two kitchens, and two bars, was designed by Think! Architecture and Design. The exterior of the building remained largely unchanged, except for the addition of a new marquee and an enlargement of its windows. In contrast to Nitehawk Williamsburg, Nitehawk Prospect Park screens a greater proportion of family and blockbuster films.\n\n",

         "Mario Power Tennis is a sports game developed by Camelot Software Planning and published by Nintendo. The game is the sequel to the Nintendo 64 title Mario Tennis, and is the fourth game in the Mario Tennis series. Power Tennis was released for the GameCube in Japan and North America in late 2004, and in PAL regions in early 2005. The game was ported for the Wii in 2009 as part of the New Play Control! series, and was also re-released as a Nintendo Selects title in 2012. A companion handheld game, Mario Tennis: Power Tour, was also released on Game Boy Advance around the same time as the original GameCube release, bearing the same title as Power Tennis in Europe.\n\nPower Tennis incorporates multiple characters, themes, and locations from the Mario series. The game includes standard tennis matches, but contains variants that feature different scoring formats and objectives. Other variants include \"Gimmick\" courts, thematic areas with components and properties that directly affect gameplay. The game has 18 playable characters, each categorised by their style of play and each with a pair of unique moves known as \"Power Shots\". Power Tennis was developed simultaneously with Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour, and the pair shared similar technology and concepts with each other during production. Such similarities include an emphasis on the Mario theme in characters and settings as well as alternative game modes such as \"Ring Shot\".\n\nThe GameCube version was positively received in general, attaining an aggregate score of 81 percent from GameRankings and 80 out of 100 from Metacritic. Critics praised the game's depth and variety, but criticised the Power Shot animations, which could not be skipped. The Wii version in contrast received a more mixed reaction, with praise for the graphics and multiplayer but criticism for its motion controls. In 2010, it was included as one of the games in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die.\n\n",

The storm moved generally to the southwest, gradually intensifying off Western Australia. On 8 April, Olivia intensified into a severe tropical cyclone and subsequently turned more to the south, steered by a passing trough. On the morning of 10 April, passing over Barrow Island off the Western Australian northwest coast, Olivia produced the strongest non-tornadic winds ever recorded, with peak gusts of 409 kilometres per hour (254 mph). On the same day the cyclone made landfall on the Pilbara coast, about 75 kilometres (47 mi) north-northwest of Pannawonica. The storm quickly weakened over land, dissipating over the Great Australian Bight on 12 April.\n\nDuring its formative stages, Olivia produced light rainfall in the Northern Territory. While offshore Western Australia, the cyclone forced oil platforms to shut down, and the combination of high winds and waves caused heavy damage to oil facilities. Onshore, Olivia's high winds damaged several small mining towns, halting operations. Every house in Pannawonica sustained some damage. One person in the town was injured by flying glass and had to be flown to receive treatment, and nine others were lightly injured. The cyclone also produced heavy rainfall and a localized storm surge. Damage was estimated \"in the millions\". While the storm was dissipating, rough seas in South Australia killed A\\$60 million (US\\$47.5 million) worth of farm-raised tuna at Port Lincoln. The name Olivia was retired after the season.\n\n",

In addition to his success in real estate and insurance, he became a leading figure in Major League Baseball's efforts to generate interest in the game worldwide.

On the way, Jane stumbles upon a letter from Tom's mother, and realises his situation: he sends money he receives from his uncle back to his parents and siblings, and his family cannot survive without it. She tells Tom that they cannot elope, not with so many people depending upon him. He insists that he and Jane must marry and tells her he will earn money, but Jane tells him that it will not be enough; he will never be able to make enough money to support his dependants with a High Court judge (his uncle) as an enemy and with a penniless wife. Distraught, Tom asks her if she loves him, and she replies, \"Yes, but if our love destroys your family, then it will destroy itself, in a long, slow degradation of guilt and regret and blame.\" Jane returns home and receives a proposal from John Warren. She declines, and suddenly accuses him of being the one who wrote to the Judge and denied her chances of happiness. Lady Gresham informs Jane that Mr. Wisley is withdrawing his proposal, but Wisley and Jane talk afterwards and part as friends. Twenty years later, Jane, now a successful author and by choice unmarried, sees Tom during a gathering. Henry, now married to Eliza, brings Tom to her. Tom introduces his eldest daughter, who admires Jane's novels. Tom's daughter asks Jane to read aloud, but as Jane rarely does so Tom remonstrates with his daughter calling her by name - which is also Jane. Astonished that he named his eldest after her, Jane agrees to her request. The last scene shows Tom's daughter sitting by Jane as she reads aloud from Pride and Prejudice, while Tom watches Jane affectionately.

         "Jan Willem Spruyt (4 July 1826 – 8 September 1908), also known as Jan Willem Spruijt and Jan Willem Landskroon Spruijt (birthname), was a South African civil servant, lawyer and statesman of Dutch descent. Spruyt was government secretary (1856–1862) and several times acting state president of the Orange Free State, and state secretary of the South African Republic (1866–1869).\n\nSpruyt grew up in the Netherlands, studied law, but did not complete his studies, and worked as a schoolteacher, before coming to South Africa. Here he practised as law agent in private practice in both Boer republics. Soon after his arrival he was also quickly enrolled in the administration of the Orange Free State, and attained a powerful position as government secretary. In this capacity he stood in for state president M.W. Pretorius several times in the period 1860–1862.

So did Spruyt, who finished his career as state secretary of the South African Republic.\n\n ## Biography\n\n",

         "## Service as a Q ship First Prize underwent a refit at Ponsharden, near Falmouth. This included the fitting of two 12-pounder guns, at the bow and stern respectively. The gun at the bow was screened within a collapsible deckhouse while that at the stern was mounted such that it could be raised from the hold. Two Lewis guns and a machinegun were also fitted. The vessel's mode of propulsion was added to, with twin 50-horsepower (37 kW) diesel motors, manufactured by Kelvin Diesels, being fitted and for communications, a radio transmitter and receiver, not typical for sailing vessels of the time, was installed. First Prize was formally commissioned into the Royal Navy on 25 April 1917, with a crew of 27, including its commander, Lieutenant William Sanders, a New Zealander serving in the Royal Naval Reserve. She departed for her first patrol the next day. In the evening of 30 April, near the Scillies in the Atlantic, First Prize was attacked by a U-boat, U-93 commanded by Edgar von Spiegel von und zu Peckelsheim. The Q ship was badly damaged by shellfire from the U-boat's deck guns. Sanders, having dispatched a panic party in a small boat thus giving the impression of a ship being abandoned, remained under cover with his men. Despite several of them being wounded, the crew remained hidden. After 20 minutes of shelling, First Prize appeared to be sinking. The U-boat approached her port quarter, whereupon Sanders ordered the White Ensign hoisted and First Prize opened fire. Within a few minutes the submarine had received severe damage to her conning tower, with several crew members blown into the water. After moving away, the U-boat disappeared from sight in mist, and was believed by the crew of First Prize to have been sunk. The panic party, still in its boat, collected three survivors, including her captain, and brought them back to First Prize. The damage to the ship was serious, and the German prisoners assisted in repairs as it made for the Irish coast and received a tow as it approached Kinsale. Despite its damage, U-93 managed to struggle back to Sylt nine days later. In the meantime, the damaged First Prize returned to her port of Milford Haven. The Admiralty had renamed her, and she was to now be known as HMS Prize.",

It travels within the Bienville National Forest and it ends at MS 35 in Lorena. The road was constructed around 1967 and was paved by 1968. The route was signed as MS 902 on state maps by 1998.\n\n## Route description\n\nAll of MS 902 is located in Smith County. In 2018, the Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) calculated 210 vehicles traveling on MS 902 north of County Road 32-A (CO 32-A) on average each day. The road is legally defined in Mississippi Code § 65-3-3, as both MS 902 and MS 35 Connector, but it is signed as MS 902. The route is maintained by MDOT as part of the Mississippi State Highway System.\n\nMS 902 starts at a three-way junction with MS 481 in the unincorporated area of Burns and travels northward. As the route is completely within the Bienville National Forest, the majority of the road is surrounded by forests, with several farms located along the way. It then intersects CO 502-A, a gravel spur route of CO 502, and CO 32-A, which travels to MS 35 near Lemon. MS 902 turns northeastwards south of CO 32-B, and continues in that direction until it ends at MS 35 in Lorena. The road continues as CO 32, which ends at CO 541 northwest of Klein.\n\n## History\n\nAround 1967, a gravel road from MS 481 to MS 35 was constructed within the Bienville National Forest in Smith County, and it was paved one year later. The road was signed as MS 902 on the state highway map by 1998.\n\n## Major intersections",

As soon as he is ordained he is to take charge of a church built for him by St. Elmo. Hammond, however, takes St. Elmo's friendship lightly and makes love to Agnes in secret. The affair is discovered by St. Elmo, who, in a rage at Hammond's perfidy, challenges him to a duel. The false friend loses his life in the ensuing combat. Edna, the granddaughter of the village blacksmith, strays upon the scene of the duel, an uninvited witness. St. Elmo is forced to flee the country. He is pursued by Agnes and the sheriff. Edna tells her first lie when she deceives St. Elmo's pursuers as to his direction and leads them completely off the trail. St. Elmo makes good his escape. On the day that Edna witnesses the duel her grandfather dies, leaving her alone in the world. She is adopted by St. Elmo's mother. Five years later the fugitive returns. Edna recognizes him as the victor of the dual but he does not remember having met her. He discovers that he loves the girl. Edna rejects his suit, declaring that she never would marry a man who had taken a human life. In desperation, St. Elmo attempts suicide, choosing as a spot the grave of Dick Hammond, but is swerved from his purpose by Edna, who relents and promises him her love and sympathy. St. Elmo decides that life is worth living if but for her sake.\"\n\n ## Cast\n\n- Frank H. Crane as St. Elmo\n- Anna Rosemond as Agnes\n- Gertrude Thanhouser\n- Carey L. Hastings\n\n",

Its accompanying music video was directed by Vincent Forcier, using concert footage from Tomahawk's 2012 concerts. Another music video was also made for the title track.\n\nOddfellows debuted at number sixteen on the UK Rock Chart album countdown on February 9, 2013, spending one week in the chart. In the United States, Oddfellows recorded positions in several of Billboard magazine's charts—reaching a peak position of 69 on the Billboard 200, 12 on the Alternative Albums listings, second place on the Hard Rock Albums chart, and ninth on the Independent Albums chart.

         "## Development and release\n\nMost of the developers at Paladin Studios had played games from Nintendo, and had been trying to do a collaboration for about ten years. Nintendo's producer, Takao Nakano, played some of the company's mobile games, and believed they put care into them. A team from Nintendo met with the company in 2017, and was interested in a prototype conceptualized by Paladin Studios. Paladin Studios wanted to make a game that was easily accessible to a broad audience; they wanted a game that could be enjoyed by children and adults, as well as one that had simple controls. They decided to set the game in an office setting, as it was easily recognizable and would allow players to use common objects in surprising ways. They liked the contrast of a mundane office setting with chaotic and destructive actions.\n\nNintendo and Paladin Studios discussed regularly and worked together on the game very closely, actively video chatting each other to collaborate. Paladin Studios, located in The Netherlands, would create a working prototype of the game and send it to Nintendo in Japan for review every day. Both countries have opposite time zones, so every morning Nintendo had a prototype they could review, and every morning Paladin Studios had a review back from Nintendo. Due to both companies being in different parts of the world, it helped further their intentions of being enjoyable by a larger group of players. Although both companies had similar ideas, they sometimes had conflicting opinions on the office setting, as certain parts of a typical building were different in the two countries.\n\nThe developers encountered multiple bugs during the game's creation, such as glitch where every object in the level would immediately be destroyed. One of the glitches, where a printer wrapped in a cable would cause it to be violently launched in all directions, inspired the creators to increase the launch speed of cables. Due to the game revolving around physics, play testers found it enjoyable to search for hidden bugs.\n\nThe game had a two-year development cycle, and was announced on March 26, 2020, releasing the same day. Nintendo only told Paladin Studios that the game would be featured in a Nintendo Direct shortly before the announcement, which caught the company by surprise. Paladin studios commented how \"Nintendo did a tremendous job at guiding us through this process and really helped us make the best content we could possibly make.\"\n\n",

His performances that season included a near-no-hitter that was lost in the ninth inning in a 5–2 victory over the Fond du Lac Panthers. Linde was also given the most valuable player award for a week in July after a pitching performance, also against Fond du Lac, in which he struck out 14 batters in a 5–0 shutout victory. He finished the season with 13 wins, eight losses, and a 2.91 ERA in 22 pitching appearances. After the season ended, the league folded temporarily, and Linde enlisted with the United States Army Air Forces to serve in World War II.\n\nAfter returning from military service, Linde joined the Greenville Spinners, the Chicago White Sox minor league affiliate of the Sally League. He tried out for the Milwaukee Brewers, but was unable to make the team, and as a result was sent to Greenville to gain experience. Linde pitched in 29 games for the Spinners. In those 29 games, he had ten wins, eight losses, a 3.50 ERA, and 121 innings pitched. After the conclusion of the season, in early November, Linde was drafted by the Cleveland Indians in the rule 5 draft.\n\nThe following season, Linde pitched for the Oklahoma City Indians, the Indians minor league affiliate of the Texas League. He spent most of the season with Oklahoma City, and in a pitching appearance in August, threw a no-hitter and narrowly missed pitching a perfect game. In 32 appearances for Oklahoma City, Linde won 14 games, lost 13, and had an ERA of 2.85 in 202 innings pitched. At the end of the minor league season, Linde was called up to the Indians' major league roster along with Ernest Groth in order to build up the end of the bullpen.\n\n",

As in many places, a war memorial committee was formed to handle the town's commemorations and raise funds, beginning its work in January 1919. There were calls from within the community for a functional memorial, such as a meeting hall—which would be of benefit to the living—rather than a decorative monument. By May, the committee had decided to allocate a minority of its funds to a decorative memorial, the rest to be used for practical purposes such as grants for war widows and orphans. They chose Lutyens to design the monument, desiring an eminent architect. Lutyens' first proposal was for a cenotaph and he built a wooden model for public exhibition on the sea front. This was rejected by public opinion, as was his next proposal, for an obelisk. The successful design, for a statue and column, was agreed in March 1920. The committee's first choice of location was Palmeira Gardens but the landowner refused permission, leaving the committee with three sites on Grand Avenue. In June 1920, Lutyens visited Hove and chose a site in the middle of the road, near its northern end and parallel to the statue of Queen Victoria at the southern end. Lutyens designed dozens of war memorials across England, though Hove's was his only one in Sussex. Many war memorials were delayed by local disagreements or fundraising problems, but Hove's proceeded relatively smoothly once the design was agreed. The project was among the first of Lutyen's to be completed.\n\n",

However, hurricanes Gilma later that year, Ioke in 2006, and hurricanes Lane and Walaka in 2018 later reached lower barometric pressures in the Central Pacific. In addition, Emilia was the first Category 5 Pacific hurricane since Hurricane Ava in 1973. The fifth named storm and the first of three Category 5 hurricanes of the 1994 hurricane season, Emilia developed from an area of low pressure southeast of Hawaii on July 16. Tracking westward, the initial tropical depression intensified into a tropical storm several hours after tropical cyclogenesis. Subsequently, Emilia entered the Central Pacific Ocean and moved into the area of responsibility of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC).\n\nAfter reaching hurricane intensity the following day, the tropical cyclone began to rapidly intensify, and late on July 19, Emilia reached its record peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 160 mph (260 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 926 mbar (926 hPa; 27.3 inHg), rating it as a Category 5 hurricane. After slight oscillations in strength, an upper-level trough forced the intense hurricane northwest on July 21, and Emilia began to weaken thereafter. The tropical cyclone encountered an area of vertical wind shear and cool sea surface temperatures, which further weakened the system. The following day, Emilia made its closest approach to the Big Island of Hawaii, but subsequently weakened to below hurricane intensity. This weakening trend continued, and the tropical cyclone fully dissipated on July 25. Though the hurricane did not make landfall, Emilia brought strong surf to the islands of Hawaii and caused gusty winds, which resulted in some property damage. Precipitation was also reported, but remained under moderate levels.\n\n",

On Denver's first drive they drove 74 yards to a 2nd and goal at the Charger 6, before John Elway's pass was intercepted in the end zone by Glenn; he took off along the right sideline, slipped one tackle, benefitted from a block by Benson, and completed a 103-yard touchdown return, the joint-longest in league history at that point. Elway bounced back on his next two drives, a 51-yard completion setting up a touchdown run, and a 46-yard completion accounting for another touchdown. After an exchange of field goals, Fouts completed four passes for 58 yards, and the Chargers reached a 3rd and goal at the Denver 7 with 17 seconds left and no timeouts, trailing 17–10. Winslow caught Fouts' next pass inside the 1, but was ruled not to have broken the plane of the goal line before being pushed back by three Broncos. Time ran out before San Diego could attempt a field goal.\n\nDenver extended their lead on their first two drives of the second half via two further Elway touchdown passes. After the second of these, the Chargers responded; Anderson had catches of 38 and 33 yards, and Adams scored on a 1-yard run with 14 minutes to play. Denver's next drive ended with a missed field goal, but ran seven minutes off the clock. Fouts drove San Diego into opposition territory before his deep pass was intercepted to effectively clinch the game for Denver. He was intercepted again in the final minute.\n\nFouts completed 23 of 40 passes for 322 yards, with 2 interceptions. The Chargers were again dominated in terms of time of possession, holding the ball for only 18:41. They gave up a season-high 522 yards of offense. While contemporary reports described Glenn's touchdown as a new record for an interception return, there had been a previous 103-yarder, by Pete Barnum in 1926. The record was tied again by Louis Oliver in 1992 and eventually broken by Ed Reed in 2004.\n\n",

         "A Song Flung Up to Heaven is the sixth book in author Maya Angelou's series of autobiographies. Set between 1965 and 1968, it begins where Angelou's previous book All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes ends, with Angelou's trip from Accra, Ghana, where she had lived for the past four years, back to the United States. Two \"calamitous events\" frame the beginning and end of the book—the assassinations of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. Angelou describes how she dealt with these events and the sweeping changes in both the country and in her personal life, and how she coped with her return home to the U.S. The book ends with Angelou at \"the threshold of her literary career\", writing the opening lines to her first autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings.\n\nAs she had begun to do in Caged Bird, and continued throughout her series, Angelou upheld the long tradition of African-American autobiography. At the same time she made a deliberate attempt to challenge the usual structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre. Most reviewers agreed that the book was made up of a series of vignettes. By the time Song was written in 2002, sixteen years after her previous autobiography, Angelou had experienced great fame and recognition as an author and poet. She recited her poem \"On the Pulse of Morning\" at the inauguration of President Bill Clinton in 1993, becoming the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since Robert Frost at John F. Kennedy's in 1961. She had become recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for Blacks and women. Angelou was, as scholar Joanne Braxton has stated, \"without a doubt, ... America's most visible black woman autobiographer\". She had also become, as reviewer Richard Long stated, \"a major autobiographical voice of the time\".\n\nThe title of Song was based upon the same poem, by African-American poet Paul Laurence Dunbar, the basis of her first autobiography. Like Angelou's other autobiographies, the book was greeted with both praise and disappointment, although reviews were generally positive. Reviewers praised Angelou for \"the culmination of a unique autobiographical achievement\", while others criticized her for coming across as \"smug\". The 2002 spoken word album by the same name, based on the book, received a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album in 2003.\n\n",

         "The Bugun liocichla (Liocichla bugunorum) is a passerine bird species from the family Leiothrichidae closely related to the Emei Shan liocichla. First spotted in 1995 in Arunachal Pradesh, India, it was described as a new species in 2006. The description was made without the collection of a type specimen as they were too few to risk killing one. It is thought to be an endangered species, with a small population, and a very restricted distribution range within which commercial development threatens the habitat.\n\n ## Description\n\nThe Bugun liocichla is a small babbler (20 cm (7.9 in)) with olive-grey plumage and a black cap. The face is marked with prominent orange-yellow lores, and the wings have yellow, red and white patches. The tail is black with crimson coloured undertail coverts and red tips. The feet are pink and the bill is black at the face fading to pale white. A second duller individual was mist netted, which was probably the female. The voice is described as fluty and distinctive.\n\nA study of the evolution of the species within the genus Liocichla based on mitochondrial DNA sequence similarity showed that the species is most closely related to L. omeiensis with the Hengduan Mountains possibly acting as the isolating barrier between the two.\n\n ## Distribution and habitat\n\nAll sightings of the species have been at an altitude of 2,000 m (6,600 ft) on disturbed hillsides covered with shrubs and small trees, with the exception of one sighting on the edge of primary forest. It lives in a territory similar to that of the Emei Shan liocichla. Small flocks were observed during January, whereas pairs were observed in May, with an estimated total of 14 individuals. It is thought that pairs may hold and defend territories. The Bugun liocichla is only currently known from just one location. Populations may be discovered in other areas of Arunachal Pradesh or neighbouring Bhutan.\n\nAttempts have been made to identify new locations where the species could occur based on identification of suitable habitats using computational models.\n\n",

         "## Taxonomy\n\nThe Madagascan sunset moth was first described by the British entomologist Dru Drury in 1773 from a specimen obtained from a Captain May of Hammersmith. Because of its resemblance to swallowtail butterflies, Drury described the species as Papilio rhipheus. The specimen Drury received had the head of a different species attached, probably that of a butterfly, which had clubbed antennae—this trait is frequently used to differentiate moths from butterflies. Once the inaccuracy in Drury's specimen was found, the moth was placed in the genus Urania, until 1823 when the German entomologist Jacob Hübner placed it in a new genus, Chrysiridia. The moth has also been described under other names. Because Drury described his specimen as having clubbed antennae and being tailless, William Swainson thought it was a different species than the complete specimen described by Pieter Cramer. In 1833, Swainson named the butterfly Rhipheus dasycephalus and the moth Leilus orientalis. Other synonyms include U. crameri by Maassen in 1879 and U. ripheus var. madagascariensis by Lesson in 1831.\n\nNative Malagasy people call it adriandolo or lolonandriana, from lolo for \"spirit\" or \"butterfly\" and andriana for \"noble\" or \"king\", therefore meaning \"noble butterfly\", \"noble spirit\", \"king butterfly\" or \"king spirit\".\n\nThe genus Chrysiridia is entirely African and the only other species in the genus is the East African C. croesus. Chrysiridia is one of three diurnal uraniine genera. The other two genera are Urania, its sister taxon, and Alcides, the most basal. In the group, the use of Endospermum is an ancestral state (a plesiomorphy). The more basal Alcides feed on Endospermum and Omphalea, while Urania and Chrysiridia feed only on Omphalea.\n\n",

Church explained that the core of the project was its \"dynamic creation\". He noted that the team had \"no set of rules ... or pre-written plan\", but rather worked organically toward the general idea of creating a \"dungeon simulation\". Church believed that the game's Ultima series heritage was extremely helpful, as it gave the team an anchor for their experiments. According to Church, because the team was young and inexperienced, they were \"improvising almost the whole time\". He said that they would \"just write something\" that seemed interesting, but would then \"get it half done, and we'd say, 'Eh? That's not working.'\" He believed that this iterative method was useful overall, but that it entailed an abnormally large workload: it resulted in the creation of \"four movement systems before we were done, several combat systems, and so forth\". Certain failed experiments meant that the team created \"[AI] code for many ideas which turned out to be largely irrelevant to the actual gameplay\". During the first year of the game's development, Church believed that Origin had little faith in the team's ability to complete the game. He later said, \"They didn't pay any attention at all, frankly.\" While Origin CEO Richard Garriott helped the team in fitting the game into the Ultima franchise, Warren Spector later said that the company seemed \"blasé\" about Ultima Underworld \"for the first several months after ORIGIN and Blue Sky signed the deal\", despite his own belief that it was a \"change-the-world project\".

According to the ALA, a challenge is an attempt by a person or group to remove or restrict materials from a library or school curriculum. The series was challenged for being too frightening for young people and depicting occult or demonic themes. By 1997, the ALA was informed of 46 challenges, over 75% of which occurred in school libraries. The rest of the challenges were held in public libraries or the location of the challenges were unknown. The same year, a hearing by the Anoka-Hennepin School District to ban the books was broadcast by C-SPAN. In the hearing, most of the parents and children felt the books should not be banned, and the school district's book review committee decided to keep the books.\n\n ## Adaptations and merchandise\n\n ### Audiobooks\n\nWalt Disney Records and Scholastic Audiobooks have adapted Goosebumps into numerous audiobooks from 1996–present.\n\n",

         "## Production\n\nJackson began work on the audiobook E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial in June 1982 – about two months after he began recording his sixth studio album Thriller. Quincy Jones served as the producer for both projects, in addition to working as the narrative writer for the audiobook. During the recording of the narration, Jackson became so upset when E.T. died that he wept. Jones and Spielberg both felt that trying to record the part again would not change the pop star's emotional reaction and decided to leave Jackson's crying in the finished recording. Jackson biographer Lisa D. Campbell wrote that Jones had learned this during the recording of \"She's Out of My Life\" (from the Off the Wall album), where the singer also broke down in tears.\n\nSeveral of the contributors to the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial storybook album had worked with Jackson on his solo projects in the past. Rod Temperton, who had written several songs featured on Off the Wall and Thriller, wrote the music for \"Someone in the Dark\". Freddy DeMann and Ron Weisner, former managers of The Jacksons, served as the production coordinators for the album. Bruce Swedien engineered E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, a task he had performed on Off the Wall and Thriller and would go on to perform for the next albums of Jackson. Dick Zimmerman photographed Jackson for the Thriller album cover, before again capturing the singer for the accompanying poster to the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial album.\n\nOnce the recording and engineering aspects of production had been completed, MCA Records (the distributor of the album) pressed more than a million copies of the audiobook. In 1982 a journalist for Billboard wrote that it was one of the \"most ambitious\" projects MCA Records had taken on to date.\n\n ## Jackson's empathy with the E.T. character\n\nJackson commented the following:\n\n> \"He's in a strange place and wants to be accepted – which is a situation that I have found myself in many times when travelling from city to city all over the world. He's most comfortable with children, and I have a great love for kids. He gives love and wants love in return, which is me. And he has that super power which lets him lift off and fly whenever he wants to get away from things on Earth, and I can identify with that. He and I are alike in many ways.\"\n\n",

         "For human use, tubes range in size from 2 to 10.5 mm (0.1 to 0.4 in) in internal diameter. The size is chosen based on the patient's body size, with the smaller sizes being used for infants and children. Most endotracheal tubes have an inflatable cuff to seal the tracheobronchial tree against leakage of respiratory gases and pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents, blood, secretions, and other fluids. Uncuffed tubes are also available, though their use is limited mostly to children (in small children, the cricoid cartilage is the narrowest portion of the airway and usually provides an adequate seal for mechanical ventilation). In addition to cuffed or uncuffed, preformed endotracheal tubes are also available. The oral and nasal RAE tubes (named after the inventors Ring, Adair and Elwyn) are the most widely used of the preformed tubes. There are a number of different types of double-lumen endo-bronchial tubes that have endobronchial as well as endotracheal channels (Carlens, White and Robertshaw tubes). These tubes are typically coaxial, with two separate channels and two separate openings. They incorporate an endotracheal lumen which terminates in the trachea and an endobronchial lumen, the distal tip of which is positioned 1–2 cm into the right or left mainstem bronchus. There is also the Univent tube, which has a single tracheal lumen and an integrated endobronchial blocker. These tubes enable one to ventilate both lungs, or either lung independently. Single-lung ventilation (allowing the lung on the operative side to collapse) can be useful during thoracic surgery, as it can facilitate the surgeon's view and access to other relevant structures within the thoracic cavity. The \"armored\" endotracheal tubes are cuffed, wire-reinforced silicone rubber tubes. They are much more flexible than polyvinyl chloride tubes, yet they are difficult to compress or kink. This can make them useful for situations in which the trachea is anticipated to remain intubated for a prolonged duration, or if the neck is to remain flexed during surgery. Most armored tubes have a Magill curve, but preformed armored RAE tubes are also available. Another type of endotracheal tube has four small openings just above the inflatable cuff, which can be used for suction of the trachea or administration of intratracheal medications if necessary. Other tubes (such as the Bivona Fome-Cuf tube) are designed specifically for use in laser surgery in and around the airway.",

They are often used in various medical settings, including surgeries and intensive care, to secure the airway.

They are available in both oral and nasal versions.\n\n2. **Preformed Nasal Tubes:** These tubes are specifically shaped to fit more comfortably and securely when inserted nasally. Their design helps ensure a stable position and reduces the likelihood of kinking.\n\n3. **Preformed Oral Tubes:** These are generally used in oral intubations and have a curve intended to help secure the airway while minimizing the risk of damage to surrounding tissues.\n\n4. **Microcuff Tubes:** These are used in pediatric care and have a thin, high-volume, low-pressure cuff to minimize pressure on the tracheal wall while still providing an effective seal.\n\nManufacturers such as Mallinckrodt, Teleflex, and others offer various models of preformed",

He had a younger brother, Theodore (Ted), who became an accomplished physicist. Ted worked for the Manhattan Project and became an atomic spy, passing nuclear secrets to the Soviet Union. The family company his father worked for, J. Holtzberg and Sons, went broke during the Great Depression and the banks foreclosed, but Edward gained admission to Townsend Harris Hall Prep School by passing a competitive examination. He earned a Bachelor of Science degree from the College of the City of New York, where education was free, in 1935 and a professional degree in chemical engineering the following year.\n\nJobs for chemical engineers were hard to find during the Great Depression years, and despite having two degrees, he was unable to find work. He suspected that this was due to the prevalent antisemitism in the United States, and in 1936 he and his brother Ted, then 11, legally changed their surname to \"Hall\". He still had trouble finding work as a chemical engineer, and for a time worked as an auto mechanic, a steamfitter, a plumber, an electrician and a radio repairman.\n\n",

The reformed band rehearsed in Stowe, Vermont and recorded the album Perfect Strangers which was followed by a highly successful world tour. Another studio album with this formation, The House of Blue Light followed in 1987 but Gillan was concerned with the final results, stating \"There's something missing in the overall album. I can't feel the spirit of the band.\" This was followed by the live album Nobody's Perfect in 1988. The live album also featured a studio re-recording of the 1968 hit \"Hush\" with Gillan on vocals, to commemorate Deep Purple's 20th anniversary. (The original 1968 release had been sung by Rod Evans). Gillan later remarked that the album was \"the embodiment of all the things wrong with Purple.\" In contrast to his experiences with Deep Purple in the 1970s, Gillan felt frustrated that the band were no longer working enough. To fulfill his contract with Virgin, he formed a side project with Glover, writing and recording songs which didn't fit Purple's established hard rock style, which resulted in the album Accidentally on Purpose. By 1989, tensions between Gillan and Blackmore had resurfaced, due to the former's greater enthusiasm for touring and differences over the music – the song \"Mitzi Dupree\" on The House of Blue Light is the original demo as Blackmore refused to re-record it. This culminated in Blackmore calling a rehearsal session without Gillan. After an acrimonious argument Glover told Gillan, \"Ian you've gone too far this time,\" and he was fired. Gillan, meanwhile, formed a new version of Garth Rockett and the Moonshiners with keyboardist Mark Buckle, bassist Keith Mulholland, drummer Louis Rosenthal and guitarists Harry Shaw and Steve Morris. The band toured regularly through 1989, and recorded the album Naked Thunder. Gillan later expressed dissatisfaction with the album, calling it \"rather hum-de-dum\".",

         "### 1970s Shortly before McCartney announced his exit from the Beatles in April 1970, he and Starr had a falling out due to McCartney's refusal to cede the release date of his eponymous solo album to allow for Starr's debut, Sentimental Journey, and the Beatles' Let It Be. Starr's album – composed of renditions of pre-rock standards that included musical arrangements by Quincy Jones, Maurice Gibb, George Martin and McCartney – peaked at number seven in the UK and number 22 in the US. Starr followed Sentimental Journey with the country-inspired Beaucoups of Blues, engineered by Scotty Moore and featuring renowned Nashville session musician Pete Drake. Despite favourable reviews, the album was a commercial failure. Starr subsequently combined his musical activities with developing a career as a film actor. Starr played drums on Lennon's John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970), Ono's Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band (1970), and on Harrison's albums All Things Must Pass (1970), Living in the Material World (1973) and Dark Horse (1974). In 1971, Starr participated in the Concert for Bangladesh, organised by Harrison, and with him co-wrote the hit single \"It Don't Come Easy\", which reached number four in both the US and the UK. The following year he released his most successful UK hit, \"Back Off Boogaloo\" (again produced and co-written by Harrison), which peaked at number two (US number nine). Having become friends with the English singer Marc Bolan, Starr made his directorial debut with the 1972 T. Rex documentary Born to Boogie. In 1973 and 1974, Starr had two number one hits in the US: \"Photograph\", a UK number eight hit co-written with Harrison, and \"You're Sixteen\", written by the Sherman Brothers. Starr's third million-selling single in the US, \"You're Sixteen\" was released in the UK in February 1974 where it peaked at number four. Both tracks appeared on Starr's debut rock album, Ringo, produced by Richard Perry and featuring further contributions from Harrison as well as a song each from Lennon and McCartney. A commercial and critical success, the LP also included \"Oh My My\", a US number five. The album reached number seven in the UK and number two in the US.",

         "Smilodon is a genus of the extinct machairodont subfamily of the felids. It is one of the best known saber-toothed predators and one of the most famous prehistoric mammals. Although commonly known as the saber-toothed tiger, it was not closely related to the tiger or other modern cats. Smilodon lived in the Americas during the Pleistocene epoch (2.5 mya – 10,000 years ago). The genus was named in 1842 based on fossils from Brazil; the generic name means \"scalpel\" or \"two-edged knife\" combined with \"tooth\". Three species are recognized today: S.gracilis, S.fatalis, and S.populator. The two latter species were probably descended from S.gracilis, which itself probably evolved from Megantereon. The hundreds of specimens obtained from the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles constitute the largest collection of Smilodon fossils. Overall, Smilodon was more robustly built than any extant cat, with particularly well-developed forelimbs and exceptionally long upper canine teeth. Its jaw had a bigger gape than that of modern cats, and its upper canines were slender and fragile, being adapted for precision killing. S.gracilis was the smallest species at 55 to 100 kg (120 to 220 lb) in weight. S.fatalis had a weight of 160 to 280 kg (350 to 620 lb) and height of 100 cm (39 in). Both of these species are mainly known from North America, but remains from South America have also been attributed to them. S.populator from South America was the largest species, at 220 to 436 kg (485 to 961 lb) in weight and 120 cm (47 in) in height, and was among the largest known felids. The coat pattern of Smilodon is unknown, but it has been artistically restored with plain or spotted patterns. In North America, Smilodon hunted large herbivores such as bison and camels, and it remained successful even when encountering new prey species in South America. Smilodon is thought to have killed its prey by holding it still with its forelimbs and biting it, but it is unclear in what manner the bite itself was delivered. Scientists debate whether Smilodon had a social or a solitary lifestyle; analysis of modern predator behavior as well as of Smilodon's fossil remains could be construed to lend support to either view. Smilodon probably lived in closed habitats such as forests and bush, which would have provided cover for ambushing prey. Smilodon died out at the same time that most North and South American megafauna disappeared, about 10,000 years ago. Its reliance on large animals has been proposed as the cause of its extinction, along with climate change and competition with other species, but the exact cause is unknown.",

These estimates are based on fossil evidence and comparative analysis with modern big cats. Smilodon populator was native to South America and was one of the largest and most robust members of the Smilodon genus.",

He demanded that his salary be doubled, or he would sit out the season and cash in on his popularity through other ventures. Ruth's salary demands were causing other players to ask for more money. Additionally, Frazee still owed Lannin as much as \\$125,000 from the purchase of the club. Although Ruppert and his co-owner, Colonel Tillinghast Huston, were both wealthy, and had aggressively purchased and traded for players in 1918 and 1919 to build a winning team, Ruppert faced losses in his brewing interests as Prohibition was implemented, and if their team left the Polo Grounds, where the Yankees were the tenants of the New York Giants, building a stadium in New York would be expensive. Nevertheless, when Frazee, who moved in the same social circles as Huston, hinted to the colonel that Ruth was available for the right price, the Yankees owners quickly pursued the purchase. Frazee sold the rights to Babe Ruth for \\$100,000, the largest sum ever paid for a baseball player. The deal also involved a \\$350,000 loan from Ruppert to Frazee, secured by a mortgage on Fenway Park. Once it was agreed, Frazee informed Barrow, who, stunned, told the owner that he was getting the worse end of the bargain. Cynics have suggested that Barrow may have played a larger role in the Ruth sale, as less than a year after, he became the Yankee general manager, and in the following years made a number of purchases of Red Sox players from Frazee. The \\$100,000 price included \\$25,000 in cash, and notes for the same amount due November 1 in 1920, 1921, and 1922; Ruppert and Huston assisted Frazee in selling the notes to banks for immediate cash. The transaction was contingent on Ruth signing a new contract, which was quickly accomplished—Ruth agreed to fulfill the remaining two years on his contract, but was given a \\$20,000 bonus, payable over two seasons. The deal was announced on January 6, 1920. Reaction in Boston was mixed: some fans were embittered at the loss of Ruth; others conceded that Ruth had become difficult to deal with.",

         "## Publication history and contents Shortly before the start of World War II, two science fiction (sf) pulp magazines were launched in Britain: Tales of Wonder, which appeared in 1937, and Fantasy, which published its first issue the following year. Fantasy was forced to close down in 1939 as the war approached: the editor, T. Stanhope Sprigg, had enlisted in the RAF, and it was clear to the publisher, George Newnes Ltd, that paper rationing would soon be implemented. Tales of Wonder, published by The World's Work, was edited by Walter Gillings, who had been active in science fiction fandom since the early 1930s. Gillings was able to keep Tales of Wonder going until 1942, despite the paper shortages; even after he was drafted he was able to edit it for a while from his army camp, but the Spring 1942 issue was the last one. By 1943 Gillings was planning a new magazine, to be published by Temple Bar. He started collecting material for it, requesting stories that showed originality and focused on \"how technological advances might affect individuals rather than whole populations\", in the words of sf historian Mike Ashley. Paper rationing was still a concern, and Temple Bar were not convinced there was a sufficient market for sf, so they kept delaying the launch. Gillings's initial request for submissions was not fruitful, but by 1946 he had acquired enough material for nine issues. This included several stories by Arthur C. Clarke, though he returned some of them to Clarke as the publication delays lengthened, suggesting Clarke try them in the American market. Two of the stories, \"Loophole\", and \"Rescue Party\", appeared in Astounding Science Fiction in the April and May 1946 issues; these were Clarke's first professional fiction sales. Temple Bar finally took the plunge in 1946, convinced by the success of New Worlds, another British sf magazine, which had been launched that summer. The first issue, in digest format, was dated December 1946. The title was Fantasy, though there was no connection to Newnes' pre-war pulp magazine of that name; it was subtitled \"The Magazine of Science Fiction\". The lead story was \"Last Conflict\", by John Russell Fearn, and the issue also included a reprint of \"The Worlds of If\", a story by Stanley Weinbaum, and Clarke's \"Technical Error\"—his first sale to a British market.",

         "Gyroporus cyanescens, commonly known as the bluing bolete or the cornflower bolete, is a species of bolete fungus in the family Gyroporaceae. First described from France in 1788, the species is found in Asia, Australia, Europe, and eastern North America, where it grows on the ground in coniferous and mixed forests.\n\nThe yellowish to buff cap surface is fibrous and roughened, and reaches up to 12 cm (4.7 in) in diameter. The thick stem, roughly the same color as the cap or lighter, is hollowed out into chambers. All parts of the mushroom turn an intense blue color within a few moments of bruising or cutting. The mushroom is edible, despite its hard stem. A less common variety occurs where the color change is to deep violet rather than blue. The bluing reaction results from the oxidation of a chemical called gyrocyanin.\n\n ## Taxonomy\n\nThe species was first described scientifically by French botanist Jean Baptiste François Pierre Bulliard in his 1788 Herbier de la France. Later synonyms include Boletus constrictus by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1801, Leccinum constrictum by Samuel Frederick Gray in 1821, Suillus cyanescens by Petter Karsten in 1882, and Leucoconius cyanescens by Günther Beck von Mannagetta und Lerchenau in 1923. The variety violaceotinctus was described by Roy Watling in 1969 from collections made in Michigan, USA.\n\nThe specific epithet is derived from the Ancient Greek κύανoς, meaning \"dark blue\", while the varietal epithet violaceotinctus means \"having a violet tinge\". It is commonly known as the bluing bolete or the cornflower bolete.\n\n",
         "What is the chemical responsible for the bluing reaction in Gyroporus cyanescens?",
         "gyrocyanin",
         "The bluing reaction in Gyroporus cyanescens, as well as in other blue-staining mushrooms, is primarily due to the oxidation of specific compounds called variegatic acid and gyroporin. When the flesh of the mushroom is damaged, these compounds are exposed to oxygen, leading to an enzymatic oxidative reaction that results in the production of blue-colored compounds, such as quinones. This reaction is facilitated by enzymes like polyphenol oxidase, which accelerates the oxidation process.",

All 30 tonnes (33 tons) of liquid steel, at a temperature of approximately 1,500 degrees Celsius (2,730 F), were spilled. This liquid steel then burst through the windows and door of an adjoining room 5 metres away where workers had gathered during a change of shifts, engulfing that room entirely.\n\nWhen emergency services arrived, they were initially unable to provide assistance as the high temperature of the molten steel prevented them from entering the area. When they were able to access the area, they discovered 32 workers had been killed by the spill. Six others in the room survived and were rushed to the hospital with severe burns. According to doctors, five workers were initially listed as being in a stable condition, whereas others were listed as critical. They were said to be at risk of contracting infections through their burns. However, an earlier statement on the website of the State Administration of Work Safety published conflicting information, saying that the 32 deceased represented everyone in the room at the time, and that only two people were injured – the operators of the ladle. The official Xinhua press agency also released a report stating that the ladle fell on workers below, but this was unclear as in to whether the workers were in fact crushed or whether this, too, conflicted with the other reports.\n\nAfter retrieving the six survivors, rescuers then recovered the bodies of the 32 deceased.\n\n",

         "## Historiography In 1913 the Bibliothèque nationale de France published a bibliography of its Collection de l'Enfer—the French equivalent of the Private Case. The move induced the lawyer and writer E. S. P. Haynes to produce \"The Taboos of the British Museum Library\", an essay in the literary magazine The English Review. Describing the existence of the Private Case as \"unsatisfactory\", he criticised the museum for censorship and wrote that \"the reputation of our National Library is suffering in consequence\" of the segregation of books. The library practice of keeping the names of Private Case books off the general catalogue he thought \"a ruinous policy, and one which in the long run may prove suicidal. Students will tend to go elsewhere\". He also stated that by censoring the existence of works in its holdings, the library \"is placing itself in a most dubious position\". Despite Haynes's essay the wider public continued to be unaware of the existence of the Private Case until the 1960s and it was only in 1962 that the library acknowledged that it held a collection of books not included in the main general catalogue. The situation of the segregated books was not discussed more widely until 1963 when there was a debate in the correspondence pages of The Times Literary Supplement about the library's policy. One of those involved in the correspondence was Peter Fryer, who went on to publish Private Case—Public Scandal: Secrets of the British Museum Revealed in 1966; the book was part of what Harris calls Fryer's \"courteous but persistent campaign on the subject\". Kearney catalogued the Private Case collection and published The Private Case: An Annotated Bibliography of the Private Case Erotica Collection in the British (Museum) Library in 1981, following seven years of research. It contains 1,920 items, although the material contains flaws. The historian A. S. G. Edwards, in an article for The Book Collector, calls the bibliography \"of very limited usefulness\", given that the book only details the works that were in the Private Case at the time of Kearney's research, and not the many items that had previously been in the case but had since been reclassified. Edwards also highlights flaws in attribution of some publications to anonymously produced books; in this way, Edwards says, it is \"very hard for the user of this work to be sure of the dividing line between hard fact and authorial conjecture\".",

The story begins during the second year of an illegal mining operation on the planet Aegis VII funded by the Unitology religious movement. The colonists discover a monolith-like artifact on Aegis VII they identify as a Marker, an object sacred to the Unitologists' beliefs. In reality, the Marker is a copy of an alien object that begins to have a fatal influence over the colony; this culminates in the colony's destruction by reanimated mutated corpses referred to outside the comic as \"Necromorphs\". The comic opens with a video log from Sergeant Abraham Neumann of the colony's P-SEC security, advising anyone still alive to nuke the planet. The story then jumps back five weeks to shortly after the Marker's discovery. While the colony was previously stable, the Marker's discovery prompts a wave of unusual incidents; beginning first as prevalent insomnia and hallucinations, many colonists then display symptoms of paranoia and become murderously violent. One of the colonists attacks medical officer Tom Sciarello, killing his assistant in the process. The Unitologists in the colony exacerbate the situation, as they attempt to worship at the Marker site. One of their number is Neumann's P-SEC partner Vera Cortez, and her beliefs and gradual decline drive a wedge between them. Marla Janssen, another P-SEC officer, becomes fascinated by symbols on the Marker seen on a leaked video. The colony leader Hanford Carthusia is given orders from the Unitology Church to safeguard the Marker until their ship, the Ishimura arrives. Between its discovery and the Ishimura's arrival, the situation deteriorates further; Sciarello treats a growing and increasingly severe outbreak of hysteria and paranoia on the colony, technician Cameron finds an unusual organic matter growing in the vent system, and one of the Marker security team Natalia Deshyanov kills a crewmember and suffers a complete breakdown. Carthusia, under orders from the Church, refuses to act and instead brings the Marker into the colony preparatory to sending both it and the colony's recent dead to the Ishimura. The Marker's approach prompts a mass suicide of Unitologists, among them Cortez.",

It was based on Bailey and Bichoff's 1976 short story, and subsequent 1979 novel, Tin Woodman. Both the short story/novel and the episode are named for the Tin Woodman from L. Frank Baum's Oz books.\n\nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, telepath Tam Elbrun (Harry Groener) joins the crew to investigate a bio ship detected near a star about to go supernova. As the crew investigates, the Romulans threaten the Enterprise and the creature, Gomtuu, and Elbrun boards it with Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner). As the star is about to explode, Gomtuu sends Data back to the Enterprise and the two ships out of the system. Gomtuu and Elbrun leave together as the star goes supernova.\n\nThe spec script was chosen as the crew believed it could go into production quickly. After purchasing it, the production of this episode began a week later. Groener guest starred as Elbrun, the first male Betazoid seen on the show. Michael Cavanaugh appeared as Captain Robert DeSoto, a character that was mentioned in \"Encounter at Farpoint\" and later in the franchise.

South of the Ann Street interchange, the highway crosses a line of the Grand Rapids Eastern Railroad. After crossing both the railroad and Ann Street, the highway widens to allow for a grassy median.

It was released in Japan in December 1995, developed by Heartbeat; whereas the previous Dragon Quest games were developed by Chunsoft.

Another version of the game for Android and iOS devices was released in Japan in June 2015.\n\nAs the sixth installment to the Dragon Quest series, the graphics and gameplay remain close to the other games, with minor additions and upgrades. The graphics were vastly improved from Dragon Quest V, which was also for the Super Famicom, but had more rudimentary graphics due to being an early game on the console. Navigation remains largely unchanged from the previous games and the turn-based battles are still in first-person. The class system from Dragon Quest III returns, with minor adjustments. Dragon Quest VI sold over three million copies in Japan, becoming the best selling game of 1995. The DS version sold an additional one million copies by March 2010.\n\nThe story follows the traditional Dragon Quest \"Hero\" on a quest to save the world. In this particular installment, the heroes also have to endure the personal struggle of amnesia, as many of the main characters do not initially remember who they are. After completing a series of quests, the player learns that in addition to a Real World, there is also a Dream World, made up of people's dreams, and that there is a great evil that wants to conquer both.

During the Battle of Port Arthur (February 1904) on the second day of the war, Peresvet was not hit, but Pobeda was hit once amidships, sustaining little damage but losing two men killed and four wounded. Pobeda struck a mine during the squadron's sortie on 13 April and remained under repair for almost two months. Both ships had some of their anti-torpedoboat guns and secondary armament removed during the summer to bolster the defenses of the port. They participated in the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August 1904; Pobeda was only lightly damaged by 11 large-caliber hits, but Peresvet, hit 39 times, suffered a considerable amount of flooding. More guns were landed after the squadron's return to Port Arthur, but the Imperial Japanese Army captured the hills overlooking the harbor in November, and this allowed Japanese 28-centimeter (11 in) siege guns to fire directly at the Russian ships. Pobeda and Peresvet were hit many times, and Pobeda sank on 7 December 1904 from the accumulated damage. Peresvet was scuttled in shallow water on the same day. Construction of Oslyabya, named after Radion Oslyabya (another monk who had fought at the Battle of Kulikovo), was greatly delayed, and the ship found herself en route to the Far East when the Russo-Japanese War began in February 1904. She was ordered home and assigned to the Second Pacific Squadron that was intended to relieve the forces in Port Arthur. The ship served as the flagship of Rear Admiral Baron Dmitry von Fölkersam, second-in-command of the squadron, but he died two days before the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905. Oslyabya led the Second Division of the squadron during the battle and was the target of numerous Japanese ships during the early part of the battle. Many of the hits on the ship were along the waterline and caused extensive flooding. Efforts to counteract the resulting list destroyed her remaining stability and she sank just over an hour after the Japanese opened fire—the first modern battleship to be sunk solely by gunfire. Sources differ on the exact number of casualties, but the lowest figure given is 471.",
         "What was the final fate of the battleship Pobeda during the Russo-Japanese War?",
         "Pobeda sank on 7 December 1904 from the accumulated damage.",
         "The battleship Pobeda, a Russian pre-dreadnought battleship, played a role in the Russo-Japanese War and was part of the Russian Pacific Squadron at Port Arthur. During the war, it was involved in several engagements but was eventually trapped in the harbor at Port Arthur along with the rest of the Russian fleet.\n\nIn December 1904, after a prolonged siege, Port Arthur fell to the Japanese. The Pobeda was scuttled by its crew to prevent it from being captured intact. However, the Japanese were able to raise and salvage the ship. They repaired and recommissioned it into the Imperial Japanese Navy as the Suwo. The ship served as a training vessel and later as a coastal defense ship until being decommissioned and scrapped several years later.",

         "### Nitehawk Prospect Park\n\nIn September 2016, Nitehawk announced plans to open a second location, Nitehawk Prospect Park, in Park Slope. It is located in an historic Art Deco movie theater adjacent to Prospect Park that operated as the Sanders Theater from 1928 to 1978, and as the Pavilion Theater from 1996 to 2016. Viragh and the building's owner had discussed converting the theater into a Nitehawk in 2011, but discussions fell through following the opening of Nitehawk Williamsburg. In 2015, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission approved a plan that would have partially converted the building into condominiums and shrunk the floor area of the theater. However, an investment firm ultimately purchased the building for \\$28 million and granted a long-term lease to Nitehawk.\n\nNitehawk Prospect Park underwent renovations through 2016 and 2017, at a cost of \"less than \\$10 million\". Originally slated to open in fall 2017, renovation delays and the discovery of historic elements from the Sanders theater amid demolition led the opening to be postponed, and it ultimately reopened on December 19, 2018. The theater, which includes seven screens, 650 seats, two kitchens, and two bars, was designed by Think! Architecture and Design. The exterior of the building remained largely unchanged, except for the addition of a new marquee and an enlargement of its windows. In contrast to Nitehawk Williamsburg, Nitehawk Prospect Park screens a greater proportion of family and blockbuster films.\n\n",

         "Mario Power Tennis is a sports game developed by Camelot Software Planning and published by Nintendo. The game is the sequel to the Nintendo 64 title Mario Tennis, and is the fourth game in the Mario Tennis series. Power Tennis was released for the GameCube in Japan and North America in late 2004, and in PAL regions in early 2005. The game was ported for the Wii in 2009 as part of the New Play Control! series, and was also re-released as a Nintendo Selects title in 2012. A companion handheld game, Mario Tennis: Power Tour, was also released on Game Boy Advance around the same time as the original GameCube release, bearing the same title as Power Tennis in Europe.\n\nPower Tennis incorporates multiple characters, themes, and locations from the Mario series. The game includes standard tennis matches, but contains variants that feature different scoring formats and objectives. Other variants include \"Gimmick\" courts, thematic areas with components and properties that directly affect gameplay. The game has 18 playable characters, each categorised by their style of play and each with a pair of unique moves known as \"Power Shots\". Power Tennis was developed simultaneously with Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour, and the pair shared similar technology and concepts with each other during production. Such similarities include an emphasis on the Mario theme in characters and settings as well as alternative game modes such as \"Ring Shot\".\n\nThe GameCube version was positively received in general, attaining an aggregate score of 81 percent from GameRankings and 80 out of 100 from Metacritic. Critics praised the game's depth and variety, but criticised the Power Shot animations, which could not be skipped. The Wii version in contrast received a more mixed reaction, with praise for the graphics and multiplayer but criticism for its motion controls. In 2010, it was included as one of the games in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die.\n\n",

Upon its completion on 9 February York was assigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron of Home Fleet.

In early April 1940, York, and the rest of her squadron, were assigned to carry troops under Plan R 4, the British plan to invade Norway. The troops were disembarked on 8 April when the British learned of the imminent German invasion of Norway and the squadron, under the command of Vice-Admiral John Cunningham, joined the bulk of the Home Fleet already at sea. On 10 April the destroyer HMS Eclipse was badly damaged by air attack and York was detailed to tow her to Lerwick for repairs. The ship, and the light cruisers HMS Manchester and HMS Birmingham, ferried the 1st Battalion of the Green Howards and other troops from Rosyth to Åndalsnes and Molde on 24–25 April.

         "Severe Tropical Cyclone Olivia was a powerful cyclone, the 13th named storm of the 1995–96 Australian region cyclone season, which formed on 3 April 1996 to the north of Australia's Northern Territory. The storm moved generally to the southwest, gradually intensifying off Western Australia. On 8 April, Olivia intensified into a severe tropical cyclone and subsequently turned more to the south, steered by a passing trough. On the morning of 10 April, passing over Barrow Island off the Western Australian northwest coast, Olivia produced the strongest non-tornadic winds ever recorded, with peak gusts of 409 kilometres per hour (254 mph). On the same day the cyclone made landfall on the Pilbara coast, about 75 kilometres (47 mi) north-northwest of Pannawonica. The storm quickly weakened over land, dissipating over the Great Australian Bight on 12 April.\n\nDuring its formative stages, Olivia produced light rainfall in the Northern Territory. While offshore Western Australia, the cyclone forced oil platforms to shut down, and the combination of high winds and waves caused heavy damage to oil facilities. Onshore, Olivia's high winds damaged several small mining towns, halting operations. Every house in Pannawonica sustained some damage. One person in the town was injured by flying glass and had to be flown to receive treatment, and nine others were lightly injured. The cyclone also produced heavy rainfall and a localized storm surge. Damage was estimated \"in the millions\". While the storm was dissipating, rough seas in South Australia killed A\\$60 million (US\\$47.5 million) worth of farm-raised tuna at Port Lincoln. The name Olivia was retired after the season.\n\n",

During his time in the Majors, he once led the National League in stolen bases, and was among the seasonal leaders in several other offensive categories including home runs, and batting average.\n\nLange was noted for having a combination of great speed and power, especially for his size. His 6-foot-1-inch (1.85 m), 190-pound (86 kg) frame was considered large for his era.

Despite the short-lived marriage, he refused all offers to return as a player.\n\nHe became a successful businessman after his retirement from baseball. In addition to his success in real estate and insurance, he became a leading figure in Major League Baseball's efforts to generate interest in the game worldwide. He was enlisted by the leading baseball figures of the day to assist in establishing leagues in several European countries, that could eventually compete against American teams, while also scouting for undiscovered talent.\n\n ## Early life\n\nBorn in the Presidio District of San Francisco, California, he ran away from home while still in grammar school to live with his brother in Port Townsend, Washington.

On the way, Jane stumbles upon a letter from Tom's mother, and realises his situation: he sends money he receives from his uncle back to his parents and siblings, and his family cannot survive without it. She tells Tom that they cannot elope, not with so many people depending upon him. He insists that he and Jane must marry and tells her he will earn money, but Jane tells him that it will not be enough; he will never be able to make enough money to support his dependants with a High Court judge (his uncle) as an enemy and with a penniless wife. Distraught, Tom asks her if she loves him, and she replies, \"Yes, but if our love destroys your family, then it will destroy itself, in a long, slow degradation of guilt and regret and blame.\" Jane returns home and receives a proposal from John Warren. She declines, and suddenly accuses him of being the one who wrote to the Judge and denied her chances of happiness. Lady Gresham informs Jane that Mr. Wisley is withdrawing his proposal, but Wisley and Jane talk afterwards and part as friends. Twenty years later, Jane, now a successful author and by choice unmarried, sees Tom during a gathering. Henry, now married to Eliza, brings Tom to her. Tom introduces his eldest daughter, who admires Jane's novels. Tom's daughter asks Jane to read aloud, but as Jane rarely does so Tom remonstrates with his daughter calling her by name - which is also Jane. Astonished that he named his eldest after her, Jane agrees to her request. The last scene shows Tom's daughter sitting by Jane as she reads aloud from Pride and Prejudice, while Tom watches Jane affectionately. As she concludes, their eyes meet and Tom joins the rest of the company in honouring Jane and her work with applause. ## Cast\n\n- Anne Hathaway as Jane Austen\n- James McAvoy as Thomas \"Tom\" Lefroy\n- Julie Walters as Mrs. Austen\n- James Cromwell as Reverend George Austen\n- Maggie Smith as Lady Gresham\n- Lucy Cohu as Eliza, Comtesse de Feuillide\n- Laurence Fox as Mr. Wisley\n- Joe Anderson as Henry Austen\n- Ian Richardson as Lord Chief Judge Langlois of London\n- Sophie Vavassuer as Jane Lefroy\n- Anna Maxwell Martin as Cassandra Austen\n- Leo Bill as John Warren\n- Jessica Ashworth as Lucy Lefroy\n- Eleanor Methven as Mrs Lefroy\n- Helen McCrory as Mrs Radcliffe\n- Tom Vaughan-Lawlor as Robert Fowle\n\n ## Production\n\n",

It belongs to a class of drugs known as meglitinides, which stimulate the pancreas to release insulin in response to meals.\n\nHere are some key points about Nulin Gel SR:\n\n1. **Indication**: Nulin Gel SR is used to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes, particularly when used in combination with diet and exercise.\n\n2. **Mechanism of Action**: It works by stimulating the pancreas to produce more insulin after meals, which helps lower blood glucose levels.\n\n3. **Dosage and Administration**: The dosing of nateglinide is typically done just before meals, and it should be taken as prescribed by a healthcare provider. The sustained-release formulation (SR) allows for a more gradual release of the medication, helping to maintain consistent blood glucose levels.\n\n4. **Side Effects**: Common side effects can include hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), nausea, diarrhea, headache, and dizziness. It is important to monitor blood sugar levels to manage any potential occurrences of hypoglycemia.\n\n5. **Precautions**: Patients with certain medical",

This is not a good screening test but a positive result is highly specific. The best investigation would be cystoscopy & biopsy. Investigations for bladder cancer 1. Urinary cytology - Exfoliated cells from both normal and neoplastic urothelium can be readily identified in voided urine. Examination of cytological specimens can detect the malignant cells either at the time of initial presentation or during follow-up. Cytological examination may be especially useful in screening high-risk population and assessing the response to treatment. 2. Cystourethroscopy and tumor resection - The diagnosis and initial staging of bladder cancer is made by cystoscopy and transurethral resection. 3.Imaging (IVP, CT, MRI) - Although various imaging techniques can detect bladder cancer, its presence is confirmed by cystoscopy & biopsy. - Therefore imaging modalities are used to image the upper urinary tract and, when infiltrating bladder tumors are detected to assess the depth of muscle wall infiltration and the presence of local & distant metastasis. - Intravenous urography remains one of the most common imaging tests for the evaluation of hematuria. However, intravenous pyelography is increasingly being replaced by computed tomography (CT) urography, which is more accurate, for evaluation of the entire abdominal cavity, renal parenchyma, and ureters in patients with hematuria. Bladder tumors may be recognized as pedunculated, radiolucent filling defects projecting into the lumen; nonpapillary, infiltrating tumors may result in fixation or flattening of the bladder wall. 4. Urinary tumor markers - - Several new tests have been developed in order to overcome the shocomings of urinary cytology such as the low sensitivity for low-grade superficial tumors and inter-observer variability. - Commercially available tests include, the BTA test, the BTA stat test, the BTA TRAK assay determination of urinary nuclear matrix protein (NMP22), Immunocyt and UroVysion . - These tests can detect cancer specific proteins in urine (BTA/NMP22) or augment cytology by identifying cell surface or cytogenetic markers in the nucleus. Other tests under investigation include identification of the Lewis X antigen on exfoliated urothelial cells, and the determination of telomerase activity in exfoliated cells. - These tests have been demonstrated to enhance detection of bladder cancer when used either individually or in combination with cytology. They have been used to detect both new index tumors as well as recurrent tumors.",
